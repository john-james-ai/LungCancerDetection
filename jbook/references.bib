	abstract = {Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are powerful models that have achieved excellent performance on difficult learning tasks. Although DNNs work well whenever large labeled training sets are available, they cannot be used to map sequences to sequences. In this paper, we present a general end-to-end approach to sequence learning that makes minimal assumptions on the sequence structure. Our method uses a multilayered Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to map the input sequence to a vector of a fixed dimensionality, and then another deep LSTM to decode the target sequence from the vector. Our main result is that on an English to French translation task from the WMT'14 dataset, the translations produced by the LSTM achieve a BLEU score of 34.8 on the entire test set, where the LSTM's BLEU score was penalized on out-of-vocabulary words. Additionally, the LSTM did not have difficulty on long sentences. For comparison, a phrase-based SMT system achieves a BLEU score of 33.3 on the same dataset. When we used the LSTM to rerank the 1000 hypotheses produced by the aforementioned SMT system, its BLEU score increases to 36.5, which is close to the previous best result on this task. The LSTM also learned sensible phrase and sentence representations that are sensitive to word order and are relatively invariant to the active and the passive voice. Finally, we found that reversing the order of the words in all source sentences (but not target sentences) improved the LSTM's performance markedly, because doing so introduced many short term dependencies between the source and the target sentence which made the optimization problem easier.},

@techreport{RecommendationSystems,
	title = {Recommendation {Systems}},
	abstract = {There is an extensive class of Web applications that involve predicting user responses to options. Such a facility is called a recommendation system. We shall begin this chapter with a survey of the most important examples of these systems. However, to bring the problem into focus, two good examples of recommendation systems are: 1. Offering news articles to on-line newspaper readers, based on a prediction of reader interests. 2. Offering customers of an on-line retailer suggestions about what they might like to buy, based on their past history of purchases and/or product searches. Recommendation systems use a number of different technologies. We can classify these systems into two broad groups. • Content-based systems examine properties of the items recommended. For instance, if a Netflix user has watched many cowboy movies, then recommend a movie classified in the database as having the "cowboy" genre. • Collaborative filtering systems recommend items based on similarity measures between users and/or items. The items recommended to a user are those preferred by similar users. This sort of recommendation system can use the groundwork laid in Chapter 3 on similarity search and Chapter 7 on clustering. However, these technologies by themselves are not sufficient , and there are some new algorithms that have proven effective for recommendation systems. 9.1 A Model for Recommendation Systems In this section we introduce a model for recommendation systems, based on a utility matrix of preferences. We introduce the concept of a "long-tail," 319},

	doi = {10.475/123},
	abstract = {In the last decade new ways of shopping online have increased the possibility of buying products and services more easily and faster than ever. In this new context, personality is a key determinant in the decision making of the consumer when shopping. The two main reasons are: firstly, a person's buying choices are influenced by psychological factors like impulsiveness, and secondly, some consumers may be more susceptible to making impulse purchases than others. To the best of our knowledge, the impact of personality factors on advertisements has been largely neglected at the level of recommender systems. This work proposes a highly innovative research which uses a personality perspective to determine the unique associations among the consumer's buying tendency and advert recommendations. As a matter of fact, the lack of a publicly available benchmark for computational advertising do not allow both the exploration of this intriguing research direction and the evaluation of state-of-the-art algorithms. We present the ADS Dataset, a publicly available benchmark for computational advertising enriched with Big-Five users' personality factors and 1,200 personal users' pictures. The proposed benchmark allows two main tasks: rating prediction over 300 real advertisements (i.e., Rich Media Ads, Image Ads, Text Ads) and click-through rate prediction. Moreover, this work carries out experiments, reviews various evaluation criteria used in the literature, and provides a library for each one of them within one integrated toolbox.},

Although a lot of job recommender systems exist that uses different strategies , here efforts have been put to make the job recommendations on the basis of candidate's profile matching as well as preserving candidate's job behavior or preferences. Firstly, rules predicting the general preferences of the different user groups are mined. Then the job recommendations to the target candidate are made on the basis of content based matching as well as candidate preferences, which are preserved either in the form of mined rules or obtained by candidate's own applied jobs history. Through this technique a significant level of accuracy has been achieved over other basic methods of job recommendations.},

	doi = {10.1145/2492517.2500266},
	abstract = {This paper presents a content-based recommender system which proposes jobs to Facebook and LinkedIn users. A variant of this recommender system is currently used by Work4, a San Francisco-based software company that offers Facebook recruitment solutions. Work4 is the world leader in social recruitment technology; to use its applications, Facebook or LinkedIn users explicitly grant access to some parts of their data, and they are presented with the jobs whose descriptions are matching their profiles the most. The profile of a user contains two types of data: interactions data (user's own data) and social connections data (user's friends data). Furthermore the users profiles and the description of jobs are divided into several parts called fields. Our experiments suggest that to predict the users interests for jobs, using basic similarity measures together with their interactions data collected by Work4 can be improved upon. The second part of this study presents a method to estimate the importance of each field of users and jobs in the task of job recommendation. Finally, the third part is devoted to the use of a machine learning algorithm in order to improve the results obtained with similarity measures: we trained a linear SVM (Support Vector Machines). Our results show that using this supervised learning procedure increases the performance of our contentbased recommender system. Copyright 2013 ACM.},

	abstract = {Coordination failure reduces match quality among employers and candidates in the job market, resulting in a large number of unflled positions and/or unstable, short-term employment. Centralized job search engines provide a platform that connects directly employers with job-seekers. However, they require users to disclose a signifcant amount of personal data, i.e., build a user profle, in order to provide meaningful recommendations. In this paper, we present PrivateJobMatch - a privacy-oriented deferred multi-match recommender system - which generates stable pairings while requiring users to provide only a partial ranking of their preferences. PrivateJobMatch explores a series of adaptations of the game-theoretic Gale-Shapley deferred acceptance algorithm which combine the fexibility of decentralized markets with the intelligence of centralized matching. We identify the shortcomings of the original algorithm when applied to a job market and propose novel solutions that rely on machine learning techniques. Experimental results on real and synthetic data confrm the benefts of the proposed algorithms across several quality measures. Over the past year, we have implemented a PrivateJobMatch prototype and deployed it in an active job market economy. Using the gathered real-user preference data, we fnd that the match recommendations are superior to a typical decentralized job market-while requiring only a partial ranking of the user preferences.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.11235},
	abstract = {Learning feature interactions is crucial for click-through rate (CTR) prediction in recommender systems. In most existing deep learning models, feature interactions are either manually designed or simply enumerated. However, enumerating all feature interactions brings large memory and computation cost. Even worse, useless interactions may introduce noise and complicate the training process. In this work, we propose a two-stage algorithm called Automatic Feature Interaction Selection (AutoFIS). AutoFIS can automatically identify important feature interactions for factorization models with computational cost just equivalent to training the target model to convergence. In the {\textbackslash}emph\{search stage\}, instead of searching over a discrete set of candidate feature interactions, we relax the choices to be continuous by introducing the architecture parameters. By implementing a regularized optimizer over the architecture parameters, the model can automatically identify and remove the redundant feature interactions during the training process of the model. In the {\textbackslash}emph\{re-train stage\}, we keep the architecture parameters serving as an attention unit to further boost the performance. Offline experiments on three large-scale datasets (two public benchmarks, one private) demonstrate that AutoFIS can significantly improve various FM based models. AutoFIS has been deployed onto the training platform of Huawei App Store recommendation service, where a 10-day online A/B test demonstrated that AutoFIS improved the DeepFM model by 20.3{\textbackslash}\% and 20.1{\textbackslash}\% in terms of CTR and ctr respectively.},

Intelligent agents can understand the world in intuitive ways with neural networks, and make action recommendations to computer users. The system discussed in this work interprets a computer screen image in order to learn new keywords from the user's screen and associate them to new contexts in a completely unsupervised way, then produce action recommendations to assist the user. It can assist in automating various tasks such as genetics research, computer programming, engaging with social media, and legal research. The action recommendations are personalized to the user, and are produced without integration of the assistant into each individual application executing on the computer. Recommendations can be accepted with a single mouse click by the computer user.},

	abstract = {Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction is one of the most important machine learning tasks in recommender systems, driving personalized experience for billions of consumers. Neural architecture search (NAS), as an emerging field, has demonstrated its capabilities in discovering powerful neural network architectures, which motivates us to explore its potential for CTR predictions. Due to 1) diverse unstructured feature interactions, 2) heterogeneous feature space, and 3) high data volume and intrinsic data randomness, it is challenging to construct, search, and compare different architectures effectively for recommendation models. To address these challenges, we propose an automated interaction architecture discovering framework for CTR prediction named AutoCTR. Via modularizing simple yet representative interactions as virtual building blocks and wiring them into a space of direct acyclic graphs, AutoCTR performs evolutionary architecture exploration with learning-to-rank guidance at the architecture level and achieves acceleration using low-fidelity model. Empirical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of AutoCTR on different datasets comparing to human-crafted architectures. The discovered architecture also enjoys generalizability and transferability among different datasets.},

These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results. We have made our two best-performing ConvNet models publicly available to facilitate further research on the use of deep visual representations in computer vision.},

We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC \& COCO 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

	abstract = {Clinical trials are important tools to improve knowledge about the effectiveness of new treatments for all diseases, including cancers. However, studies show that fewer than 5\% of cancer patients are enrolled in any type of research study or clinical trial. Although there is a wide variety of reasons for the low participation rate, we address this issue by designing a chatbot to help users determine their eligibility via interactive, two-way communication. The chatbot is supported by a user-centered classifier that uses an active deep learning approach to separate complex eligibility criteria into questions that can be easily answered by users and information that requires verification by their doctors. We collected all the available clinical trial eligibility criteria from the National Cancer Institute's website to evaluate the chatbot and the classifier. Experimental results show that the active deep learning classifier outperforms the baseline k-nearest neighbor method. In addition, an in-person experiment was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the chatbot. The results indicate that the participants who used the chatbot achieved better understanding about eligibility than those who used only the website. Furthermore, interfaces with chatbots were rated significantly better in terms of perceived usability, interactivity, and dialogue.},

With the great success of deep learning in many fields, there is an emerging trend to deploy deep learning on mobile and embedded devices to better meet the requirement of real-time applications and user privacy protection. However, the limited resources of mobile and embedded devices make it challenging to fulfill the intensive computation and storage demand of deep learning models. In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive review on the related issues for deep learning on mobile and embedded devices. We start with a brief introduction of deep learning and discuss major challenges of implementing deep learning models on mobile and embedded devices. We then conduct an in-depth survey on important compression and acceleration techniques that help adapt deep learning models to mobile and embedded devices, which we specifically classify as pruning, quantization, model distillation, network design strategies, and low-rank factorization. We elaborate on the hardware-based solutions, including mobile GPU, FPGA, and ASIC, and describe software frameworks for mobile deep learning models, especially the development of frameworks based on OpenCL and RenderScript. After that, we present the application of mobile deep learning in a variety of areas, such as navigation, health, speech recognition, and information security. Finally, we discuss some future directions for deep learning on mobile and embedded devices to inspire further research in this area.},

Specifically, we design a multi-modal price suggestion system which takes as input the extracted visual and textual features along with some statistical item features collected from the second-hand item shopping platform to determine whether the image and text of an uploaded second-hand item are qualified for reasonable price suggestion with a binary classification model, and provide price suggestions for second-hand items with qualified images and text descriptions with a regression model. To satisfy different demands, two different constraints are added into the joint training of the classification model and the regression model. Moreover, a customized loss function is designed for optimizing the regression model to provide price suggestions for second-hand items, which can not only maximize the gain of the sellers but also facilitate the online transaction. We also derive a set of metrics to better evaluate the proposed price suggestion system. Extensive experiments on a large real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed multi-modal price suggestion system.},

	abstract = {In modern online advertising systems, the click-through rate (CTR) is an important index to measure the popularity of an item. It refers to the ratio of users who click on a specific advertisement to the number of total users who view it. Predicting the CTR of an item in advance can improve the accuracy of the advertisement recommendation. And it is commonly calculated based on users’ interests. Thus, extracting users’ interests is of great importance in CTR prediction tasks. In the literature, a lot of studies treat the interaction between users and items as sequential data and apply the recurrent neural network (RNN) model to extract users’ interests. However, these solutions cannot handle the case when the sequence length is relatively long, e.g., over 100. This is because of the vanishing gradient problem of RNN, i.e., the model cannot learn a users’ previous behaviors that are too far away from the current moment. To address this problem, we propose a new Core Interest Network (CIN) model to mitigate the problem of a long sequence in the CTR prediction task with sequential data. In brief, we first extract the core interests of users and then use the refined data as the input of subsequent learning tasks. Extensive evaluations on real dataset show that our CIN model can outperform the state-of-the-art solutions in terms of prediction accuracy.},

	abstract = {Click-through rate prediction plays an important role in many fields, such as recommender and advertising systems. It is one of the crucial parts to improve user experience and increase industry revenue. Recently, several deep learning-based models are successfully applied to this area. Some existing studies further model user representation based on user historical behavior sequence, in order to capture dynamic and evolving interests. We observe that users usually have multiple interests at a time and the latent dominant interest is expressed by the behavior. The switch of latent dominant interest results in the behavior changes. Thus, modeling and tracking latent multiple interests would be beneficial. In this paper, we propose a novel method named as Deep Multi-Interest Network (DMIN) which models user’s latent multiple interests for click-through rate prediction task. Specifically, we design a Behavior Refiner Layer using multi-head self-attention to capture better user historical item representations. Then the Multi-Interest Extractor Layer is applied to extract multiple user interests. We evaluate our method on three real-world datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed DMIN outperforms various state-of-the-art baselines in terms of click-through rate prediction task.},

	abstract = {Traditional recommendation systems estimate user preference on items from past interaction history, thus suffering from the limitations of obtaining fine-grained and dynamic user preference. Conversational recommendation system (CRS) brings revolutions to those limitations by enabling the system to directly ask users about their preferred attributes on items. However, existing CRS methods do not make full use of such advantage — they only use the attribute feedback in rather implicit ways such as updating the latent user representation. In this paper, we propose Conversational Path Reasoning (CPR), a generic framework that models conversational recommendation as an interactive path reasoning problem on a graph. It walks through the attribute vertices by following user feedback, utilizing the user preferred attributes in an explicit way. By leveraging on the graph structure, CPR is able to prune off many irrelevant candidate attributes, leading to better chance of hitting user preferred attributes. To demonstrate how CPR works, we propose a simple yet effective instantiation named SCPR (Simple CPR). We perform empirical studies on the multi-round conversational recommendation scenario, the most realistic CRS setting so far that considers multiple rounds of asking attributes and recommending items. Through extensive experiments on two datasets Yelp and LastFM, we validate the effectiveness of our SCPR, which significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art CRS methods EAR [13] and CRM [24]. In particular, we find that the more attributes there are, the more advantages our method can achieve.},

However, little work has investigated these issues so far. In this paper, we first contribute with two hierarchical taxonomies for classifying user intents and recommender actions respectively based on grounded theory. We then define various categories of feature considering content, discourse, sentiment, and context to predict users’ intents and satisfaction by comparing different machine learning methods. The experimental results for user intent prediction task show that some models (such as XGBoost and SVM) can perform well in predicting user intents, and incorporating context features into the prediction model can significantly boost the performance. Our empirical study also demonstrates that leveraging dialogue behavior features (i.e., including both user intents and recommender actions) can achieve good results in predicting user satisfaction.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in personalized recommendation have sparked great interest in the exploitation of rich structured information provided by knowledge graphs. Unlike most existing approaches that only focus on leveraging knowledge graphs for more accurate recommendation, we perform explicit reasoning with knowledge for decision making so that the recommendations are generated and supported by an interpretable causal inference procedure. To this end, we propose a method called Policy-Guided Path Reasoning (PGPR), which couples recommendation and interpretability by providing actual paths in a knowledge graph. Our contributions include four aspects. We first highlight the significance of incorporating knowledge graphs into recommendation to formally define and interpret the reasoning process. Second, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) approach featuring an innovative soft reward strategy, user-conditional action pruning and a multi-hop scoring function. Third, we design a policy-guided graph search algorithm to efficiently and effectively sample reasoning paths for recommendation. Finally, we extensively evaluate our method on several large-scale real-world benchmark datasets, obtaining favorable results compared with state-of-the-art methods.},

	abstract = {We developed a model predicting the probability of success (PoS) for single planned or ongoing PhIII trials based on information available at trial initiation. Such a model is highly relevant for study sponsors to capture risk and opportunity on a trial to trial basis through trial optimization, and for investors to select drugs whose trial design match their investment strategy.
Objectives: To predict the outcome of planned or ongoing PhIII trials in oncology, given publicly available prior information
Design, Setting, Participants: Predictive modeling using publicly available data for 360 completed PhIII and 1240 PhII studies initiated between 2003 and 2012. Success and failure of PhIII studies were modeled using Bayesian logistic regression model.
Main Outcome Measures: Predicted PoS of individual PhIII trials based on a Bayesian model calibrated on publicly available data translated into 16 composite scores. Those scores cover aspects such as trial design, indication, number of patients, phase II (PhII) study outcomes, experience of sponsor at time of trial initiation, and others.
Results: The model allows to calculate the PoS distribution,  including credible intervals, for a PhIII trial in oncology. The predictive performance was determined using an area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC), resulting in an overall performance of 73\%oPP (mean AUROC). We identified two key factors contributing to the predictive performance of the model: quality and strength of PhII data and experience of the sponsor at the time of study initiation.
Conclusion and Relevance: We describe the generation and application of a statistical model predicting the PoS for individual PhIII trials in oncological indications with unprecedented predictive performance. Compared to other approaches, this is the first study generating a fully transparent model resulting in trial specific PoS distributions. Moreover, we have shown that qualitative concepts such as PhII knowledge or sponsor R\&D strength can be captured in quantitative scores and that these scores have a high predictive power.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE Drug development in oncology currently is facing a conjunction of an increasing number of antineoplastic agents (ANAs) candidate for phase I clinical trials (P1CTs) and an important attrition rate for ﬁnal approval. We aimed to develop a machine learning algorithm (RESOLVED2) to predict drug development outcome, which could support early go/no-go decisions after P1CTs by better selection of drugs suitable for further development.
METHODS PubMed abstracts of P1CTs reporting on ANAs were used together with pharmacologic data from the DrugBank5.0 database to model time to US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval (FDA approval-free survival) since the ﬁrst P1CT publication. The RESOLVED2 model was trained with machine learning methods. Its performance was evaluated on an independent test set with weighted concordance index (IPCW).
RESULTS We identiﬁed 462 ANAs from PubMed that matched with DrugBank5.0 (P1CT publication dates 1972 to 2017). Among 1,411 variables, 28 were used by RESOLVED2 to model the FDA approval-free survival, with an IPCW of 0.89 on the independent test set. RESOLVED2 outperformed a model that was based on efﬁcacy/toxicity (IPCW, 0.69). In the test set at 6 years of follow-up, 73\% (95\% CI, 49\% to 86\%) of drugs predicted to be approved were approved, whereas 92\% (95\% CI, 87\% to 98\%) of drugs predicted to be nonapproved were still not approved (log-rank P , .001). A predicted approved drug was 16 times more likely to be approved than a predicted nonapproved drug (hazard ratio, 16.4; 95\% CI, 8.40 to 32.2).
CONCLUSION As soon as P1CT completion, RESOLVED2 can predict accurately the time to FDA approval. We provide the proof of concept that drug development outcome can be predicted by machine learning strategies.},

We found that the selected heuristics were useful with good coverage in our application case. However, based on our observations, we argue that interaction, veracity, and aesthetics related heuristics should be added to the previously used set. The lack of domain knowledge made the evaluators somewhat uneasy with their capability to carry out the investigation in-depth. We suggest to train domain experts with understanding of the data and application domain to carry out the evaluation to get insightful feedback beyond usability issues.},

By combining a custom developed messaging bus with a web service implementation, a dynamic, interactive immersive environment is provided across a number of platforms including CAVEs, touch tables, single wall displays, and desktops. We provide an architecture discussion including driver capabilities to enable quick development of additional data sources with existing visualization applications.

	abstract = {In applied visualization research, artifacts are shaped by a series of small design decisions, many of which are evaluated quickly and informally via methods that often go unreported and unveriﬁed. Such design decisions are inﬂuenced not only by visualization theory, but also by the people and context of the research. While existing applied visualization models support a level of reliability throughout the design process, they fail to explicitly account for the inﬂuence of the research context in shaping the resulting design artifacts. In this work, we look to action design research (ADR) for insight into addressing this issue. In particular, ADR oﬀers a framework along with a set of guiding principles for navigating and capitalizing on the disruptive, subjective, human-centered nature of applied design work, while aiming to ensure reliability of the process and design, and emphasizing opportunities for conducting research. We explore the utility of ADR in increasing the reliability of applied visualization design research by: describing ADR in the language and constructs developed within the visualization community; comparing ADR to existing visualization methodologies; and analyzing a recent design study retrospectively through the lens of ADR’s framework and principles.},

However, identifying the drug-target interactions in clinical trials requires a lot of financial resources and time. More and more computational methods are currently used for drug-target interaction predictions. This paper proposes a drug-target interaction prediction method that can integrate information from different heterogeneous networks. This method constructs multiple drug and target similarity networks and applies the GraRep algorithm on the similarity networks after denoising in order to extract the features. Features obtained from heterogeneous networks are combined as a feature vector of DTIs, which is the input of Random Forest. The result of our experiment shows that our method in this paper increases the accuracy of prediction for DTIs, which is superior to other state-of-the-art approaches.},

	abstract = {Clinical trials are crucial for the advancement of treatment and knowledge within the medical community. Since 2007, US federal government took the initiative and required organizations sponsoring clinical trials with at least one site in the United States to submit information on these clinical trials to the ClinicalTrials.gov database, resulting in a rich source of information for clinical trial research. Nevertheless, only a handful of analytic studies have been carried out to understand this valuable data source. In this study, we propose to use network analysis to understand infectious disease clinical trial research. Our goal is to answer two important questions: (1) what are the concentrations and characteristics of infectious disease clinical trial research? and (2) how to accurately predict what type of clinical trials a sponsor (or an investigator) are interested in? The answers to the first question provide effective ways to summarize clinical trial research related to particular disease(s), and the answers to the second question help match clinical trial sponsors and investigators for information recommendation. By using 4,228 clinical trials as the test bed, our study involves 4,864 sponsors and 1,879 research areas characterized by Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) keywords. We extract a set of network measures to show patterns of infectious disease clinical trials, and design a new community based link prediction approach to predict sponsors’ interests, with significant improvement compared to baselines. This trans-formative study concludes that using network analysis can tremendously help the understanding of clinical trial research for effective summarization, characterization, and prediction.},

            Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successfully used in many applications where important information about data is embedded in the order of features, such as speech and imaging. However, most tabular data do not assume a spatial relationship between features, and thus are unsuitable for modeling using CNNs. To meet this challenge, we develop a novel algorithm, image generator for tabular data (IGTD), to transform tabular data into images by assigning features to pixel positions so that similar features are close to each other in the image. The algorithm searches for an optimized assignment by minimizing the difference between the ranking of distances between features and the ranking of distances between their assigned pixels in the image. We apply IGTD to transform gene expression profiles of cancer cell lines (CCLs) and molecular descriptors of drugs into their respective image representations. Compared with existing transformation methods, IGTD generates compact image representations with better preservation of feature neighborhood structure. Evaluated on benchmark drug screening datasets, CNNs trained on IGTD image representations of CCLs and drugs exhibit a better performance of predicting anti-cancer drug response than both CNNs trained on alternative image representations and prediction models trained on the original tabular data.},

To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efﬁcient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overﬁtting in the fully-connected layers we employed a recently-developed regularization method called “dropout” that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3\%, compared to 26.2\% achieved by the second-best entry.},

For a given accuracy level, it is typically possible to identify multiple CNN architectures that achieve that accuracy level. With equivalent accuracy, smaller CNN architectures offer at least three advantages: (1) Smaller CNNs require less communication across servers during distributed training. (2) Smaller CNNs require less bandwidth to export a new model from the cloud to an autonomous car. (3) Smaller CNNs are more feasible to deploy on FPGAs and other hardware with limited memory. To provide all of these advantages, we propose a small CNN architecture called SqueezeNet. SqueezeNet achieves AlexNet-level accuracy on ImageNet with 50x fewer parameters. Additionally, with model compression techniques, we are able to compress SqueezeNet to less than 0.5MB (510× smaller than AlexNet).},

However, excessive CSI feedback for large antenna arrays is inefﬁcient and thus undesirable in practical applications. By exploiting the inherent correlation characteristics of complex-valued channel responses in the angulardelay domain, we propose a novel neural network (NN) architecture, namely ENet, for CSI compression and feedback in m-MIMO. Even if the ENet processes the real and imaginary parts of the CSI values separately, its special structure enables the network trained for the real part only to be reused for the imaginary part. The proposed ENet shows enhanced performance with the network size reduced by nearly an order of magnitude compared to the existing NN-based solutions. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed ENet.},

	abstract = {Recent work has shown that convolutional networks can be substantially deeper, more accurate, and efficient to train if they contain shorter connections between layers close to the input and those close to the output. In this paper, we embrace this observation and introduce the Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet), which connects each layer to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion. Whereas traditional convolutional networks with L layers have L connections - one between each layer and its subsequent layer - our network has L(L+1)/2 direct connections. For each layer, the feature-maps of all preceding layers are used as inputs, and its own feature-maps are used as inputs into all subsequent layers. DenseNets have several compelling advantages: they alleviate the vanishing-gradient problem, strengthen feature propagation, encourage feature reuse, and substantially reduce the number of parameters. We evaluate our proposed architecture on four highly competitive object recognition benchmark tasks (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and ImageNet). DenseNets obtain significant improvements over the state-of-the-art on most of them, whilst requiring less computation to achieve high performance.

We estimate the probabilities of success (PoS) of clinical trials for vaccines and other anti-infective therapeutics using 43,414 unique triplets of clinical trial, drug, and disease between January 1, 2000, and January 7, 2020, yielding 2,544 vaccine programs and 6,829 non-vaccine programs targeting infectious diseases. The overall estimated PoS for an industry-sponsored vaccine program is 39.6\%, and 16.3\% for an industry-sponsored anti-infective therapeutic. Among industry-sponsored vaccines programs, only 12 out of 27 disease categories have seen at least one approval, with the most successful being against monkeypox (100\%), rotavirus (78.7\%), and Japanese encephalitis (67.6\%). The three infectious diseases with the highest PoS for industry-sponsored nonvaccine therapeutics are smallpox (100\%), CMV (31.8\%), and onychomycosis (29.8\%). Nonindustry-sponsored vaccine and non-vaccine development programs have lower overall PoSs: 6.8\% and 8.2\%, respectively. Viruses involved in recent outbreaks—MERS, SARS, Ebola, Zika—have had a combined total of only 45 non-vaccine development programs initiated over the past two decades, and no approved therapy to date (Note: our data was obtained just before the COVID-19 outbreak and do not contain information about the programs targeting this disease.) These estimates offer guidance both to biopharma investors as well as to policymakers seeking to identify areas most likely to be undeserved by private-sector engagement and in need of public-sector support.},

	abstract = {This study examined the outcomes of recent confirmatory randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in phase 3 that were initiated between 2005 and 2017 for oncological drugs in the United States and identified several factors that were associated with the success of RCTs. Our regression analysis showed that studies with progression-free survival or response rate as primary endpoint were more likely to succeed than studies with overall survival (odds ratio (OR)=2.94 and 6.23, respectively). The status of development was also linked with success rates. Studies for non-lead indication tended to have lower success rates than studies for lead indication (OR=0.68). Studies for first-line therapy were observed to have low success rates compared with studies for post second-line therapies (OR=0.37). Studies for which strong prior evidence was not listed in their publication tended to be more successful than studies that followed rigorous RCTs or single arm studies for the indication. These results suggest that historical success rates may reflect not only the important features of trials, which can be observed directly from study design and results, but also the background status of trials in clinical development pathways.},

	abstract = {The current success rate of a drug candidate, from the beginning of the clinical trial to receiving marketing approval, is about 10\%–2­ 0\%, and it has not changed during the past few decades. Therefore, pharmaceutical companies are under pressure to select one compound, among many others, with a high probability of success. The differences in drug features affect their probabilities of approval success. In this study, we examined the approval success rates of drug candidates, developed in the United States, the European Union, or Japan, by focusing on four parameters (“drug target,” “drug action,” “drug modality,” and “drug application”) and their combinations, and identified factors that conditioned the outcome of the drug development process. We obtained a total success rate of 12.8\%, after evaluating 3999 compounds. Moreover, after analyzing the combinations of these parameters, the approval success rates of drugs that corresponded to the following categories—­a stimulant in drug action or an enzyme in drug target and biologics (excluding monoclonal antibody) in drug modality—­were high (34.1\% and 31.3\%, respectively). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that stimulant in drug action, and “B” (blood and blood forming organs), “G” (genito-u­ rinary system and sex), and “J” (anti-i­nfectives for systemic use) in drug application were statistically associated with high approval success rates. We found several parameters and their combinations that affected drug approval success rates. Our results could assist pharmaceutical companies in evaluating the probability of success of their drug candidates and, thus, in efficiently conducting the clinical development process.},

The simulation model utilizes available data about each drug/indication in the industry R\&D pipeline, and transforms it into a set of metrics characterizing future industry performance. Industry-wide portfolio simulation model was developed to address short- and longterm portfolio productivity forecasting challenges. The model is drug–centric, it simulates drug development work ow process. The model also incorporates multiple business rules related to drugs interdependence.

	abstract = {Background:  Studies on the early 2000s documented increasing attrition rates and duration of clinical trials, leading to a representation of a “productivity crisis” in pharmaceutical research and development (R\&D). In this paper, we produce a new set of analyses for the last decade and report a recent increase of R\&D productivity within the industry.
Methods:  We use an extensive data set on the development history of more than 50,000 projects between 1990 and 2017, which we integrate with data on sales, patents, and anagraphical information on each institution involved. We devise an indicator to quantify the novelty of each project, based on its set of mechanisms of action.
Results:  First, we investigate how R\&D projects are allocated across therapeutic areas and find a polarization towards high uncertainty/high potential reward indications, with a strong focus on oncology. Second, we find that attrition rates have been decreasing at all stages of clinical research in recent years. In parallel, for each phase, we observe a significant reduction of time required to identify projects to be discontinued. Moreover, our analysis shows that more recent successful R\&D projects are increasingly based on novel mechanisms of action and target novel indications, which are characterized by relatively small patient populations. Third, we find that the number of R\&D projects on advanced therapies is also growing. Finally, we investigate the relative contribution to productivity variations of different types of institutions along the drug development process, with a specific focus on the distinction between the roles of Originators and Developers of R\&D projects. We document that in the last decade Originator–Developer collaborations in which biotech companies act as Developers have been growing in importance. Moreover, we show that biotechnology companies have reached levels of productivity in project development that are equivalent to those of large pharmaceutical companies.
Conclusions:  Our study reports on the state of R\&D productivity in the bio-pharmaceutical industry, finding several signals of an improving performance, with R\&D projects becoming more targeted and novel in terms of indications and mechanisms of action.},

	abstract = {Deep learning revolutionized data science, and recently its popularity has grown exponentially, as did the amount of papers employing deep networks. Vision tasks, such as human pose estimation, did not escape from this trend. There is a large number of deep models, where small changes in the network architecture, or in the data pre-processing, together with the stochastic nature of the optimization procedures, produce notably different results, making extremely difﬁcult to sift methods that signiﬁcantly outperform others. This situation motivates the current study, in which we perform a systematic evaluation and statistical analysis of vanilla deep regression, i.e. convolutional neural networks with a linear regression top layer. This is the ﬁrst comprehensive analysis of deep regression techniques. We perform experiments on four vision problems, and report conﬁdence intervals for the median performance as well as the statistical signiﬁcance of the results, if any. Surprisingly, the variability due to different data pre-processing procedures generally eclipses the variability due to modiﬁcations in the network architecture. Our results reinforce the hypothesis according to which, in general, a general-purpose network (e.g. VGG-16 or ResNet-50) adequately tuned can yield results close to the state-of-the-art without having to resort to more complex and ad-hoc regression models.},

In particular, we discuss k-LinReg, a straightforward and easy to implement algorithm in the spirit of k-means for the nonconvex optimization problem at the core of switched linear regression, and focus on the question of its accuracy on large data sets and its ability to reach global optimality. To this end, we emphasize the relationship between the sample size and the probability of obtaining a local minimum close to the global one with a random initialization. This is achieved through the estimation of a model of the behavior of this probability with respect to the problem dimensions. This model can then be used to tune the number of restarts required to obtain a global solution with high probability. Experiments show that the model can accurately predict the probability of success and that, despite its simplicity, the resulting algorithm can outperform more complicated approaches in both speed and accuracy.},

Models such as Naive Bayes, which make unrealistic independence assumptions, push probabilities toward 0 and 1. Other models such as neural nets and bagged trees do not have these biases and predict well calibrated probabilities. We experiment with two ways of correcting the biased probabilities predicted by some learning methods: Platt Scaling and Isotonic Regression. We qualitatively examine what kinds of distortions these calibration methods are suitable for and quantitatively examine how much data they need to be effective. The empirical results show that after calibration boosted trees, random forests, and SVMs predict the best probabilities.},

To predict the overall treatment eﬀect for patients enrolled into a Phase 3 trial, we propose a framework consisting of two models. First, an individual trough pharmacokinetic concentration (Ctrough) model is developed to predict the trough pharmacokinetic concentration for a potentially new treatment regime planned for Phase 3. Second, an individual treatment eﬀect model is built to model the relationship between patient baseline characteristics, Ctrough and clinical outcomes. These two models are combined together to predict Phase 3 clinical trial results. Since the clinical outcomes to be predicted are longitudinal and the predictors are a mix of time-invariant and timevariant variables, a novel neural network, Residual Semi-Recurrent Neural Network, is developed for both models. The proposed framework is applied in a post-hoc prediction of Phase 3 clinical trial results, and it outperforms the traditional method.},

	abstract = {The opportunity cost of the capital invested in pharmaceutical research and development (R\&D) to bring a new drug to market makes up as much as half the total cost. However, the literature on the cost of pharmaceutical R\&D is mixed on how, exactly, one should calculate this “hidden” cost. Some authors attempt to adopt models from the field of finance, whereas other prominent authors dismiss this practice as biased, arguing that it artificially inflates the R\&D cost to justify higher prices for pharmaceuticals. In this article, we examine the arguments made by both sides of the debate and then explain the cost of capital concept and describe in detail how this value is calculated. Given the significant contribution of the cost of capital to the overall cost of new drug R\&D, a clear understanding of the concept is critical for policy makers, investors, and those involved directly in the R\&D.},

Identifying these trials provides information to sponsors facing difficult decisions about whether these higher risk trials should be modified or halted. We also find common protocol characteristics across therapeutic areas that are linked to phase success, including the number of endpoints and the complexity of the eligibility criteria.},

            DrugCentral is a public resource (http://drugcentral.org) that serves the scientific community by providing up-to-date drug information, as described in previous papers. The current release includes 109 newly approved (October 2018 through March 2020) active pharmaceutical ingredients in the US, Europe, Japan and other countries; and two molecular entities (e.g. mefuparib) of interest for COVID19. New additions include a set of pharmacokinetic properties for ∼1000 drugs, and a sex-based separation of side effects, processed from FAERS (FDA Adverse Event Reporting System); as well as a drug repositioning prioritization scheme based on the market availability and intellectual property rights forFDA approved drugs. In the context of the COVID19 pandemic, we also incorporated REDIAL-2020, a machine learning platform that estimates anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities, as well as the ‘drugs in news’ feature offers a brief enumeration of the most interesting drugs at the present moment. The full database dump and data files are available for download from the DrugCentral web portal.},

Storytellers, especially online journalists, have increasingly been integrating visualizations into their narratives, in some cases allowing the visualization to function in place of a written story. In this paper, we systematically review the design space of this emerging class of visualizations. Drawing on case studies from news media to visualization research, we identify distinct genres of narrative visualization. We characterize these design differences, together with interactivity and messaging, in terms of the balance between the narrative ﬂow intended by the author (imposed by graphical elements and the interface) and story discovery on the part of the reader (often through interactive exploration). Our framework suggests design strategies for narrative visualization, including promising under-explored approaches to journalistic storytelling and educational media.},

	abstract = {The goal of the research described in this paper is to develop an application-independent presentation tool that automatically designs effective graphical presentations (such as bar charts, scatter plots, and connected graphs) of relational information. Two problems are raised by this goal: The codification of graphic design criteria in a form that can be used by the presentation tool, and the generation of a wide variety of designs so that the presentation tool can accommodate a wide variety of information. The approach described in this paper is based on the view that graphical presentations are sentences of graphical languages. The graphic design issues are codified as expressiveness and effectiveness criteria for graphical languages. Expressiveness criteria determine whether a graphical language can express the desired information. Effectiveness criteria determine whether a graphical language exploits the capabilities of the output medium and the human visual system. A wide variety of designs can be systematically generated by using a composition algebra that composes a small set of primitive graphical languages. Artificial intelligence techniques are used to implement a prototype presentation tool called APT (A Presentation Tool), which is based on the composition algebra and the graphic design criteria.},

	title = {A {Context}-{Aware} {User}-{Item} {Representation} {Learning} for {Item} {Recommendation}},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.02342},
	abstract = {Both reviews and user-item interactions (i.e., rating scores) have been widely adopted for user rating prediction. However, these existing techniques mainly extract the latent representations for users and items in an independent and static manner. That is, a single static feature vector is derived to encode her preference without considering the particular characteristics of each candidate item. We argue that this static encoding scheme is difﬁcult to fully capture the users’ preference. In this paper, we propose a novel context-aware user-item representation learning model for rating prediction, named CARL. Namely, CARL derives a joint representation for a given user-item pair based on their individual latent features and latent feature interactions. Then, CARL adopts Factorization Machines to further model higher-order feature interactions on the basis of the user-item pair for rating prediction. Speciﬁcally, two separate learning components are devised in CARL to exploit review data and interaction data respectively: review-based feature learning and interaction-based feature learning. In review-based learning component, with convolution operations and attention mechanism, the relevant features for a user-item pair are extracted by jointly considering their corresponding reviews. However, these features are only reivew-driven and may not be comprehensive. Hence, interaction-based learning component further extracts complementary features from interaction data alone, also on the basis of user-item pairs. The ﬁnal rating score is then derived with a dynamic linear fusion mechanism. Experiments on ﬁve real-world datasets show that CARL achieves signiﬁcantly better rating predication accuracy than existing state-of-the-art alternatives. Also, with attention mechanism, we show that the relevant information in reviews can be highlighted to interpret the rating prediction.},

These explanations can not only improve users’ experiences, but also change their perception of the recommendation quality. This work describes our human-centered design for our conversational movie recommendation agent, which explains its decisions as humans would. After exploring and analyzing a corpus of dyadic interactions, we developed a computational model of explanations. We then incorporated this model in the architecture of a conversational agent and evaluated the resulting system via a user experiment. Our results show that social explanations can improve the perceived quality of both the system and the interaction, regardless of the intrinsic quality of the recommendations.},

Current research often assumes a one-shot interaction paradigm, where the users’ preferences are estimated based on past observed behavior and where the presentation of a ranked list of suggestions is the main, one-directional form of user interaction. Conversational recommender systems (CRS) take a different approach and support a richer set of interactions. These interactions can, for example, help to improve the preference elicitation process or allow the user to ask questions about the recommendations and to give feedback. The interest in CRS has significantly increased in the past few years. This development is mainly due to the significant progress in the area of natural language processing, the emergence of new voice-controlled home assistants, and the increased use of chatbot technology. With this article, we provide a detailed survey of existing approaches to conversational recommendation. We categorize these approaches in various dimensions, e.g., in terms of the supported user intents or the knowledge they use in the background. Moreover, we discuss technological approaches, review how CRS are evaluated, and finally identify a number of gaps that deserve more research in the future.},

Recommend systems based on different algorithms as one of the basic ways to reach this goal through the internet have been proposed but each of them has their own advantages and disadvantages. In this study, we have selected and implemented two approaches which are Collaborative Filtering (CF) and Social Network Recommendations System (SNRS). Based on some limitations to finding a dataset which covers friendship, rating and item categories we generated it for 10 categories, 10 items, and 100 users and compared two approaches. We used Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and accuracy to compare the result of two mentioned approaches and found that the SNRS method as it is claimed to be improved version of CF works more efficiency.},

In this work, we present a real time category based conversational recommendation approach, which can provide concise explanations without prior user knowledge being required. We ﬁrst perform an explainable user model in the form of preferences over the items’ categories, and then use the category preferences to recommend items. The user model is performed by applying a BERT-based neural architecture on the conversation. Then, we translate the user model into item recommendation scores using a Feed Forward Network. User preferences during the conversation in our approach are represented by category vectors which are directly interpretable. The experimental results on the real conversational recommendation dataset ReDial [12] demonstrate comparable performance to the state-of-the-art, while our approach is explainable. We also show the potential power of our framework by involving an oracle setting of category preference prediction.},

Recently, providing explanations about why items are recommended has attracted increasing attention due to its capability to enhance user trust and satisfaction. In this paper, we propose a co-attentive multitask learning model for explainable recommendation. Our model improves both prediction accuracy and explainability of recommendation by fully exploiting the correlations between the recommendation task and the explanation task. In particular, we design an encoder-selector-decoder architecture inspired by human’s information-processing model in cognitive psychology. We also propose a hierarchical co-attentive selector to effectively model the cross knowledge transferred for both tasks. Our model not only enhances prediction accuracy of the recommendation task, but also generates linguistic explanations that are ﬂuent, useful, and highly personalized. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.},

E-commerce companies such as Amazon, eBay, JD, Alibaba etc. are piloting such kind of agents with their users. However, the research on this topic is very limited and existing solutions are either based on single round adhoc search engine or traditional multi round dialog system. They usually only utilize user inputs in the current session, ignoring users’ long term preferences. On the other hand, it is well known that sales conversion rate can be greatly improved based on recommender systems, which learn user preferences based on past purchasing behavior and optimize business oriented metrics such as conversion rate or expected revenue. In this work, we propose to integrate research in dialog systems and recommender systems into a novel and unified deep reinforcement learning framework to build a personalized conversational recommendation agent that optimizes a per session based utility function.},

Even though DAs are able to complete tasks such as sending texts, making phone calls, or playing songs, they do not yet implement recommendation facilities. In this paper, we investigate the combination of Digital Assistants and Conversational Recommender Systems (CoRSs) by designing and implementing a framework named ConveRSE (Conversational Recommender System framEwork), for building chatbots that can recommend items from different domains and interact with the user through natural language. Since a CoRS architecture is generally composed of different elements, we performed an in-vitro experiment with two synthetic datasets, to investigate the impact that each component has on the CoRS in terms of recommendation accuracy. Additionally, an in-vivo experiment was carried out to understand how natural language influences both the cost of interaction and recommendation accuracy of a CoRS. Experimental results have revealed the most critical components in a CoRS architecture, especially in cold-start situations, and the main issues of the natural-language-based interaction. All the dialogues have been collected in a public available dataset.},

	abstract = {Recommender systems have been attracting much attention from both academia and industry because of their ability to capture user interests and generate personalized item recommendations. As the life pace in contemporary society speeds up, traditional recommender systems are inevitably limited by their disconnected interaction styles and low adaptivity to users’ evolving demands. Consequently, conversational recommender systems emerge as a prospective research area, where an intelligent dialogue agent is integrated with a recommender system. Conversational recommender systems possess the ability to accurately understand end-users’ intent or request and generate human-like dialogue responses when performing recommendations. However, existing conversational recommender systems only allow the systems to ask users for more preference information, while users’ further questions and concerns about the recommended items (e.g., enquiring the location of a recommended restaurant) can hardly be addressed. Though the recent task-oriented dialogue systems allow for two-way communications, they are not easy to train because of their high dependence on human guidance in terms of user intent recognition and system response generation. Hence, to enable two-way human-machine communications and tackle the challenges brought by manually crafted rules, we propose Conversational Recommender System with Adversarial Learning (CRSAL), a novel end-to-end system to tackle the task of conversational recommendation. In CRSAL, we innovatively design a fully statistical dialogue state tracker coupled with a neural policy agent to precisely capture each user’s intent from limited dialogue data and generate conversational recommendation actions. We further develop an adversarial Actor-Critic reinforcement learning approach to adaptively refine the quality of generated system actions, thus ensuring coherent human-like dialogue responses. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets fully demonstrate the superiority of CRSAL on conversational recommendation tasks.},

	abstract = {Providing explanations for recommended items not only allows users to understand the reason for receiving recommendations but also provides users with an opportunity to re�ne recommendations by critiquing undesired parts of the explanation. While much research focuses on improving the explanation of recommendations, less e�ort has focused on interactive recommendation by allowing a user to critique explanations. Aside from traditional constraint- and utility-based critiquing systems, the only end-to-end deep learning based critiquing approach in the literature so far, CE-VNCF, su�ers from unstable and ine�cient training performance. In this paper, we propose a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) based critiquing system to mitigate these issues and improve overall performance. The proposed model generates keyphrase-based explanations of recommendations and allows users to critique the generated explanations to re�ne their personalized recommendations. Our experiments show promising results: (1) The proposed model is competitive in terms of general performance in comparison to state-of-the-art recommenders, despite having an augmented loss function to support explanation and critiquing. (2) The proposed model can generate high-quality explanations compared to user or item keyphrase popularity baselines. (3) The proposed model is more e�ective in re�ning recommendations based on critiquing than CE-VNCF, where the rank of critiquing-a�ected items drops while general recommendation performance remains stable. In summary, this paper presents a signi�cantly improved method for multi-step deep critiquing based recommender systems based on the VAE framework.},

The utility of recommender systems cannot be overstated, given its widespread adoption in many web applications, along with its potential impact to ameliorate many problems related to over-choice. In recent years, deep learning has garnered considerable interest in many research fields such as computer vision and natural language processing, owing not only to stellar performance but also the attractive property of learning feature representations from scratch. The influence of deep learning is also pervasive, recently demonstrating its effectiveness when applied to information retrieval and recommender systems research. Evidently, the field of deep learning in recommender system is flourishing. This article aims to provide a comprehensive review of recent research efforts on deep learning based recommender systems. More concretely, we provide and devise a taxonomy of deep learning based recommendation models, along with providing a comprehensive summary of the state-of-the-art. Finally, we expand on current trends and provide new perspectives pertaining to this new exciting development of the field.},

	abstract = {For better user satisfaction and business effectiveness, Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction is one of the most important tasks in Ecommerce. It is often the case that users’ interests different from their past routines may emerge or impressions such as promotional items may burst in a very short period. In essence, such changes relate to item evolution problem, which has not been investigated by previous studies. The state-of-the-art methods in the sequential recommendation, which use simple user behaviors, are incapable of modeling these changes sufficiently. It is because, in the user behaviors, outdated interests may exist and the popularity of an item over time is not well represented. To address these limitations, we introduce time-aware item behaviors for addressing the recommendation of emerging preference. The time-aware item behavior for an item is a set of users who interact with this item with timestamps. The rich interaction information of users for an item may help to model its evolution. In this work, we propose a CTR prediction model TIEN based on the time-aware item behavior. In TIEN, by leveraging the interaction time intervals, information of similar users in a short time interval helps identify the emerging user interest of the target user. By using the sequential time intervals, the item’s popularity over time can be captured in evolutionary item dynamics. Noisy users who interact with items accidentally are further eliminated thus learning robust personalized item dynamics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to the item evolution problem for E-commerce CTR prediction. We conduct extensive experiments on five real-world CTR prediction datasets. The results show that the TIEN model consistently achieves remarkable improvements to the state-of-the-art methods.},

As a result, the algorithm predicts not only a user’s preference over a list of items, i.e., recommendation, but also how the user would appreciate a particular item at the feature level, i.e., opinionated textual explanation. Extensive experiments on two large collections of Amazon and Yelp reviews confirmed the effectiveness of our solution in both recommendation and explanation tasks, compared with several existing recommendation algorithms. And our extensive user study clearly demonstrates the practical value of the explainable recommendations generated by our algorithm.},

	abstract = {In this paper we describe a method for computing item based recommendations using matrix-factorization-like embeddings of the items computed using a neural network. Matrix factorizations (MF) compute near optimal item embeddings by minimizing a loss that measures the discrepancy between the predicted and known values of a sparse user-item rating matrix. Though useful for recommendation tasks, they are computationally intensive and hard to compute for large sets of users and items. Hence there is need to compute MF-like embeddings using other less computationally intensive methods, which can be substituted for the actual ones. In this work we explore the possibility of doing the same using a deep neural network (DNN). Our network is trained to learn matrix-factorizationlike embeddings from easy to compute natural language processing (NLP) based semantic embeddings. The resulting MF-like embeddings are used to compute recommendations using an anonymized user product engagement dataset from the online retail company Overstock.com. We present the results of using our embeddings for computing recommendations with the Overstock.com production dataset consisting of ∼3.5 million items and ∼6 million users. Recommendations from Overstock.com’s own recommendation system is compared against those obtained by using our MF-like embeddings, by comparing the results from both to the ground truth, which in our case is actual user co-clicks data. Our results show that it is possible to use DNNs for efficiently computing MFlike embeddings which can then be used in conjunction with the NLP based embeddings to improve the recommendations obtained from the NLP based embeddings.},

	abstract = {The chit-chat-based conversational recommendation systems (CRS) provide item recommendations to users through natural language interactions. To better understand user’s intentions, external knowledge graphs (KG) have been introduced into chit-chat-based CRS. However, existing chit-chat-based CRS usually generate repetitive item recommendations, and they cannot properly infuse knowledge from KG into CRS to generate informative responses. To remedy these issues, we first reformulate the conversational recommendation task to highlight that the recommended items should be new and possibly interested by users. Then, we propose the KnowledgeEnriched Conversational Recommendation System (KECRS). Specifically, we develop the Bag-of-Entity (BOE) loss and the infusion loss to better integrate KG with CRS for generating more diverse and informative responses. BOE loss provides an additional supervision signal to guide CRS to learn from both human-written utterances and KG. Infusion loss bridges the gap between the word embeddings and entity embeddings by minimizing distances of the same words in these two embeddings. Moreover, we facilitate our study by constructing a high-quality KG, i.e., The Movie Domain Knowledge Graph (TMDKG). Experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate that KECRS outperforms state-of-the-art chitchat-based CRS, in terms of both recommendation accuracy and response generation quality.},

This paper addresses both challenges in the context of constraintbased recommenders where users specify their requirements and the system recommends a solution. We propose a novel approach to determine value ordering heuristics on the basis of matrix factorization. As far as we are aware, no researches exist in constraint-based recommendation domain which exploit matrix factorization techniques. The main idea of our approach consists in the prediction of value ordering heuristics based on historical transactions which can either represent past customer purchases or requirements. Thereby, value ordering heuristics are computed which are specific to each user’s requirements. A series of experiments on real-world datasets for calculating constraint-based recommendations has shown that our approach outperforms compared methods in terms of runtime efficiency and prediction quality.},

	abstract = {Product feature recommendations are critical for online customers to purchase the right products based on the right features. For a customer, selecting the product that has the best trade-off between price and functionality is a time-consuming step in an online shopping experience, and customers can be overwhelmed by the available choices. However, determining the set of product features that most differentiate a particular product is still an open question in online recommender systems. In this paper, we focus on using interpretable machine learning methods to tackle this problem. First, we identify this unique product feature recommendation problem from a business perspective on a major US e-commerce site. Second, we formulate the problem into a price-driven supervised learning problem to discover the product features that could best explain the price of a product in a given product category. We build machine learning models with a model-agnostic method Shapley Values to understand the importance of each feature, rank and recommend the most essential features. Third, we leverage human experts to evaluate its relevancy. The results show that our method is superior to a strong baseline method based on customer behavior and significantly boosts the coverage by 45\%. Finally, our proposed method shows comparable conversion rate against the baseline in online A/B tests.},

Extreme sparse and large scale data makes online advertising a challenging problem. To achieve better performance and accuracy of the recommendation, a better model with a short turnaround time is needed. In this paper, we address the problem of personalized online advertising for extreme sparse and large scale data. We develop a novel machine learning model (Similarity Powered Pairwise Amplifier Network, SPPAN for short). The complexity of this model (a.k.a. the number of parameters) grows with the amount of observed data, which makes it suitable to extremely sparse data. The training algorithm based on gradient descent makes it easy to parallelize. The similarity model combines the user neighborhood and item neighborhood ideas in collaborative filtering smartly, obtaining a cost-effective way to handle large scale data. The proposed framework is evaluated on a large set of real-world data set from a large internet company (expressed by “Company A”). The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed SPPAN model can greatly improve the prediction and recommendation accuracy on that extreme sparse data set compared with existing approaches.},

To this end, the recommendation system within a social network adopts topical attention and probabilistic matrix factorization (STAPMF) is proposed. We combine the trust information in social networks and the topical information from review documents by proposing a novel algorithm combining probabilistic matrix factorization and attention-based recurrent neural networks to extract item underlying feature vectors, user’s personal potential feature vectors, and user’s social hidden feature vectors, which represent the features extracted from the user’s trusted network.

Individual preference and interpersonal influence are important contextual factors for social recommendations, as they affect users' decisions about information retention. The goal of this paper is to identify the state of the art in RS with the use of social elements. For this, a systematic mapping of the literature was conducted, revealing a growing trend in the number of articles published in the last ten years, especially in China, and with more frequent proposals for new models, systems and frameworks for recommendation. Almost half of the mapped articles present as a domain Entertainment or Product Review/Evaluation, with the collaborative filtering approach being the most common of the approaches used, and the similarity of friends as the most common of the social components considered. As an evaluation strategy, more than half of the mapped articles use offline experiments in a previously populated database to simulate user actions. The mapping showed that although RSs are considering social elements, there is still a lack of works that explore these elements in real contexts of use.},

	abstract = {Recommender systems play a crucial role in our daily lives. Feed streaming mechanism has been widely used in the recommender system, especially on the mobile Apps. The feed streaming setting provides users the interactive manner of recommendation in never-ending feeds. In such a manner, a good recommender system should pay more attention to user stickiness, which is far beyond classical instant metrics and typically measured by long-term user engagement. Directly optimizing long-term user engagement is a non-trivial problem, as the learning target is usually not available for conventional supervised learning methods. Though reinforcement learning (RL) naturally fits the problem of maximizing the long term rewards, applying RL to optimize long-term user engagement is still facing challenges: user behaviors are versatile to model, which typically consists of both instant feedback (e.g., clicks) and delayed feedback (e.g., dwell time, revisit); in addition, performing effective off-policy learning is still immature, especially when combining bootstrapping and function approximation. To address these issues, in this work, we introduce a RL framework — FeedRec to optimize the long-term user engagement. FeedRec includes two components: 1) a Q-Network which designed in hierarchical LSTM takes charge of modeling complex user behaviors, and 2) a S-Network, which simulates the environment, assists the Q-Network and voids the instability of convergence in policy learning. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and a real-world large scale data show that FeedRec effectively optimizes the long-term user engagement and outperforms state-of-the-arts.},

Both types of additional information can be used to improve the performance of state-of-the-art matrix factorization-based techniques. In this paper, we propose new methods to combine both social and sequential information simultaneously, in order to further improve recommendation performance.

In this work, we integrate regression trees to guide the learning of latent factor models for recommendation, and use the learnt tree structure to explain the resulting latent factors. Specifically, we build regression trees on users and items respectively with usergenerated reviews, and associate a latent profile to each node on the trees to represent users and items. With the growth of regression tree, the latent factors are gradually refined under the regularization imposed by the tree structure. As a result, we are able to track the creation of latent profiles by looking into the path of each factor on regression trees, which thus serves as an explanation for the resulting recommendations. Extensive experiments on two large collections of Amazon and Yelp reviews demonstrate the advantage of our model over several competitive baseline algorithms. Besides, our extensive user study also confirms the practical value of explainable recommendations generated by our model.},

We suggest a content-based recommendation engine, which automatically provides best suggestions to users by matching their interests and skills with the features of a job posting. In order to produce an intended recommendation, the proposed engine applies various text filters and feature similarity measurements. Similarity techniques use the bag of n-grams and topic models as the elements of feature vectors. The validations and testing of the model on real data obtained from a top job posting website show the applicability and efficiency of using topic models as features. The approach is generic and can be replicated to different industries.},

@article{roffoPersonalityAwareRecommendation,
	title = {Towards {Personality}-{Aware} {Recommendation}},
	abstract = {In the last decade new ways of shopping online have increased the possibility of buying products and services more easily and faster than ever. In this new context, personality is a key determinant in the decision making of the consumer when shopping. The two main reasons are: ﬁrstly, a person’s buying choices are inﬂuenced by psychological factors like impulsiveness, and secondly, some consumers may be more susceptible to making impulse purchases than others. To the best of our knowledge, the impact of personality factors on advertisements has been largely neglected at the level of recommender systems. This work proposes a highly innovative research which uses a personality perspective to determine the unique associations among the consumer’s buying tendency and advert recommendations. As a matter of fact, the lack of a publicly available benchmark for computational advertising do not allow both the exploration of this intriguing research direction and the evaluation of state-of-the-art algorithms. We present the ADS Dataset, a publicly available benchmark for computational advertising enriched with Big-Five users’ personality factors and 1,200 personal users’ pictures. The proposed benchmark allows two main tasks: rating prediction over 300 real advertisements (i.e., Rich Media Ads, Image Ads, Text Ads) and click-through rate prediction. Moreover, this work carries out experiments, reviews various evaluation criteria used in the literature, and provides a library for each one of them within one integrated toolbox.},

	abstract = {Conversational and question-based recommender systems have gained increasing attention in recent years, with users enabled to converse with the system and better control recommendations. Nevertheless, research in the field is still limited, compared to traditional recommender systems. In this work, we propose a novel Question-based recommendation method, Qrec, to assist users to find items interactively, by answering automatically constructed and algorithmically chosen questions. Previous conversational recommender systems ask users to express their preferences over items or item facets. Our model, instead, asks users to express their preferences over descriptive item features. The model is first trained offline by a novel matrix factorization algorithm, and then iteratively updates the user and item latent factors online by a closed-form solution based on the user answers. Meanwhile, our model infers the underlying user belief and preferences over items to learn an optimal question-asking strategy by using Generalized Binary Search, so as to ask a sequence of questions to the user. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed matrix factorization model outperforms the traditional Probabilistic Matrix Factorization model. Further, our proposed Qrec model can greatly improve the performance of state-of-the-art baselines, and it is also effective in the case of cold-start user and item recommendations.},

With less feature engineering, deep neural networks can generalize better to unseen feature combinations through low-dimensional dense embeddings learned for the sparse features. However, deep neural networks with embeddings can over-generalize and recommend less relevant items when the user-item interactions are sparse and high-rank. In this paper, we present Wide \& Deep learning—jointly trained wide linear models and deep neural networks—to combine the beneﬁts of memorization and generalization for recommender systems. We productionized and evaluated the system on Google Play, a commercial mobile app store with over one billion active users and over one million apps.

	abstract = {User reviews contain rich semantics towards the preference of users to features of items. Recently, many deep learning based solutions have been proposed by exploiting reviews for recommendation. The attention mechanism is mainly adopted in these works to identify words or aspects that are important for rating prediction. However, it is still hard to understand whether a user likes or dislikes an aspect of an item according to what viewpoint the user holds and to what extent, without examining the review details. Here, we consider a pair of a viewpoint held by a user and an aspect of an item as a logic unit. Reasoning a rating behavior by discovering the informative logic units from the reviews and resolving their corresponding sentiments could enable a better rating prediction with explanation.},

	abstract = {Collaborative filtering (CF) is a common recommendation approach that relies on user-item ratings. However, the natural sparsity of user-item rating data can be problematic in many domains and settings, limiting the ability to generate accurate predictions and effective recommendations. Moreover, in some CF approaches latent features are often used to represent users and items, which can lead to a lack of recommendation transparency and explainability. User-generated, customer reviews are now commonplace on many websites, providing users with an opportunity to convey their experiences and opinions of products and services. As such, these reviews have the potential to serve as a useful source of recommendation data, through capturing valuable sentiment information about particular product features. In this paper, we present a novel deep learning recommendation model, which co-learns user and item information from ratings and customer reviews, by optimizing matrix factorization and an attention-based GRU network. Using real-world datasets we show a significant improvement in recommendation performance, compared to a variety of alternatives. Furthermore, the approach is useful when it comes to assigning intuitive meanings to latent features to improve the transparency and explainability of recommender systems.},

	abstract = {Reviews information is dominant for users to make online purchasing decisions in e-commerces. However, the usefulness of reviews is varied. We argue that less-useful reviews hurt model’s performance, and are also less meaningful for user’s reference. While some existing models utilize reviews for improving the performance of recommender systems, few of them consider the usefulness of reviews for recommendation quality. In this paper, we introduce a novel attention mechanism to explore the usefulness of reviews, and propose a Neural Attentional Regression model with Review-level Explanations (NARRE) for recommendation. Speci cally, NARRE can not only predict precise ratings, but also learn the usefulness of each review simultaneously. Therefore, the highly-useful reviews are obtained which provide review-level explanations to help users make better and faster decisions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets of Amazon and Yelp on di erent domains show that the proposed NARRE model consistently outperforms the state-ofthe-art recommendation approaches, including PMF, NMF, SVD++, HFT, and DeepCoNN in terms of rating prediction, by the proposed attention model that takes review usefulness into consideration. Furthermore, the selected reviews are shown to be e ective when taking existing review-usefulness ratings in the system as ground truth. Besides, crowd-sourcing based evaluations reveal that in most cases, NARRE achieves equal or even better performances than system’s usefulness rating method in selecting reviews. And it is exible to o er great help on the dominant cases in real ecommerce scenarios when the ratings on review-usefulness are not available in the system.},

	abstract = {Recently, many e-commerce websites have encouraged their users to rate shopping items and write review texts. This review information has been very useful for understanding user preferences and item properties, as well as enhancing the capability to make personalized recommendations of these websites. In this paper, we propose to model user preferences and item properties using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with dual local and global attention, motivated by the superiority of CNNs to extract complex features. By using aggregated review texts from a user and aggregated review text for an item, our model can learn the unique features (embedding) of each user and each item. These features are then used to predict ratings. We train these user and item networks jointly which enable the interaction between users and items in a similar way as matrix factorization. The local attention provides us insight on a user’s preferences or an item’s properties. The global attention helps CNNs focus on the semantic meaning of the whole review text. Thus, the combined local and global attentions enable an interpretable and better-learned representation of users and items. We validate the proposed models by testing on popular review datasets in Yelp and Amazon and compare the results with matrix factorization (MF), the hidden factor and topical (HFT) model, and the recently proposed convolutional matrix factorization (ConvMF+). Our proposed CNNs with dual attention model outperforms HFT and ConvMF+ in terms of mean square errors (MSE). In addition, we compare the user/item embeddings learned from these models for classi cation and recommendation. These results also con rm the superior quality of user/item embeddings learned from our model.},

	abstract = {Background Missed vascular events, infections, and cancers account for {\textasciitilde}75\% of serious harms from diagnostic errors. Just 15 diseases from these “Big Three” categories account for nearly half of all serious misdiagnosis-related harms in malpractice claims. As part of a larger project estimating total US burden of serious misdiagnosis-related harms, we performed a focused literature review to measure diagnostic error and harm rates for these 15 conditions. Methods We searched PubMed, Google, and cited references. For errors, we selected high-quality, modern, US-based studies, if available, and best available evidence otherwise. For harms, we used literature-based estimates of the generic (disease-agnostic) rate of serious harms (morbidity/mortality) per diagnostic error and applied claims-based severity weights to construct disease-specific rates. Results were validated via expert review and comparison to prior literature that used different methods. We used Monte Carlo analysis to construct probabilistic plausible ranges (PPRs) around estimates. Results Rates for the 15 diseases were drawn from 28 published studies representing 91,755 patients. Diagnostic error (false negative) rates ranged from 2.2\% (myocardial infarction) to 62.1\% (spinal abscess), with a median of 13.6\% [interquartile range (IQR) 9.2–24.7] and an aggregate mean of 9.7\% (PPR 8.2–12.3). Serious misdiagnosis-related harm rates per incident disease case ranged from 1.2\% (myocardial infarction) to 35.6\% (spinal abscess), with a median of 5.5\% (IQR 4.6–13.6) and an aggregate mean of 5.2\% (PPR 4.5–6.7). Rates were considered face valid by domain experts and consistent with prior literature reports. Conclusions Diagnostic improvement initiatives should focus on dangerous conditions with higher diagnostic error and misdiagnosis-related harm rates.},

	abstract = {Humans inevitably develop a sense of the relationships between objects, some of which are based on their appearance. Some pairs of objects might be seen as being alternatives to each other (such as two pairs of jeans), while others may be seen as being complementary (such as a pair of jeans and a matching shirt). This information guides many of the choices that people make, from buying clothes to their interactions with each other. We seek here to model this human sense of the relationships between objects based on their appearance. Our approach is not based on fine-grained modeling of user annotations but rather on capturing the largest dataset possible and developing a scalable method for uncovering human notions of the visual relationships within. We cast this as a network inference problem defined on graphs of related images, and provide a large-scale dataset for the training and evaluation of the same. The system we develop is capable of recommending which clothes and accessories will go well together (and which will not), amongst a host of other applications.},

	abstract = {Several recent works have considered the problem of generating reviews (or ‘tips’) as a form of explanation as to why a recommendation might match a user’s interests. While promising, we demonstrate that existing approaches struggle (in terms of both quality and content) to generate justiﬁcations that are relevant to users’ decision-making process. We seek to introduce new datasets and methods to address this recommendation justiﬁcation task. In terms of data, we ﬁrst propose an ‘extractive’ approach to identify review segments which justify users’ intentions; this approach is then used to distantly label massive review corpora and construct largescale personalized recommendation justiﬁcation datasets. In terms of generation, we design two personalized generation models with this data: (1) a reference-based Seq2Seq model with aspect-planning which can generate justiﬁcations covering different aspects, and (2) an aspect-conditional masked language model which can generate diverse justiﬁcations based on templates extracted from justiﬁcation histories. We conduct experiments on two real-world datasets which show that our model is capable of generating convincing and diverse justiﬁcations.},

	abstract = {Recommender systems are now popular both commercially and in the research community, where many approaches have been suggested for providing recommendations. In many cases a system designer that wishes to employ a recommendation system must choose between a set of candidate approaches. A ﬁrst step towards selecting an appropriate algorithm is to decide which properties of the application to focus upon when making this choice. Indeed, recommendation systems have a variety of properties that may affect user experience, such as accuracy, robustness, scalability, and so forth. In this paper we discuss how to compare recommenders based on a set of properties that are relevant for the application. We focus on comparative studies, where a few algorithms are compared using some evaluation metric, rather than absolute benchmarking of algorithms. We describe experimental settings appropriate for making choices between algorithms. We review three types of experiments, starting with an ofﬂine setting, where recommendation approaches are compared without user interaction, then reviewing user studies, where a small group of subjects experiment with the system and report on the experience, and ﬁnally describe large scale online experiments, where real user populations interact with the system. In each of these cases we describe types of questions that can be answered, and suggest protocols for experimentation. We also discuss how to draw trustworthy conclusions from the conducted experiments. We then review a large set of properties, and explain how to evaluate systems given relevant properties. We also survey a large set of evaluation metrics in the context of the property that they evaluate.},

Boole considers language not just as a mode of expression, but as a system one can use to understand the human mind. In the first 12 chapters, he sets down the rules necessary to represent logic in this unique way. Then he analyses a variety of arguments and propositions of various writers from Aristotle to Spinoza. One of history's most insightful mathematicians, Boole is compelling reading for today's student of intellectual history and the science of the mind.},

	abstract = {The collaborative filtering method is widely used in the traditional recommendation system. The collaborative filtering method based on matrix factorization treats the user’s preference for the item as a linear combination of the user and the item latent vectors, and cannot learn a deeper feature representation. In addition, the cold start and data sparsity remain major problems for collaborative filtering. To tackle these problems, some scholars have proposed to use deep neural network to extract text information, but did not consider the impact of long-distance dependent information and key information on their models. In this paper, we propose a neural collaborative filtering recommender method that integrates user and item auxiliary information. This method fully integrates user-item rating information, user assistance information and item text assistance information for feature extraction. First, Stacked Denoising Auto Encoder is used to extract user features, and Gated Recurrent Unit with auxiliary information is used to extract items’ latent vectors, respectively. The attention mechanism is used to learn key information when extracting text features. Second, the latent vectors learned by deep learning techniques are used in multi-layer nonlinear networks to learn more abstract and deeper feature representations to predict user preferences. According to the verification results on the MovieLens data set, the proposed model outperforms other traditional approaches and deep learning models making it state of the art.},

The research presented in this paper was carried out as follows: the data was pre-processed, before being converted from text to vector representation using a range of feature extraction techniques such as bag-of-words, TF-IDF, Glove, and word2vec. We study the performance of different machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, stochastic gradient descent, naive Bayes and convolutional neural networks. In addition, we evaluate our models using accuracy, F1score, precision, recall and log loss function. Moreover, we apply Lime technique to provide analytical reasons for the reviews being classiﬁed as either positive, negative or neutral.

To this end, this article presents a survey and framework intended to share knowledge and experiences of XAI design and evaluation methods across multiple disciplines. Aiming to support diverse design goals and evaluation methods in XAI research, after a thorough review of XAI related papers in the fields of machine learning, visualization, and human-computer interaction, we present a categorization of XAI design goals and evaluation methods. Our categorization presents the mapping between design goals for different XAI user groups and their evaluation methods. From our findings, we develop a framework with step-by-step design guidelines paired with evaluation methods to close the iterative design and evaluation cycles in multidisciplinary XAI teams. Further, we provide summarized ready-to-use tables of evaluation methods and recommendations for different goals in XAI research.},

Firstly, we review the development trend of personalized information recommendation algorithms in the past 15 years. And then we propose a new classification method for users’ personalized recommendation based on machine learning algorithms with cold start, data sparseness, and the performance of the algorithm as the main goals. On this basis, we summarize and compare the ideas, practices and conclusions of related machine learning algorithms. Finally, we further summarize the main advantages and disadvantages of the 10 kinds of personalized recommendation algorithms from the perspective of classification proposed, and look forward to the development directions, difficulties, focus and methods of personalized recommendation algorithms.},

In comparison to traditional machine learning methods such as decision trees and support vector machines, deep learning methods have achieved substantial improvement in various prediction tasks. However, deep neural networks (DNNs) are comparably weak in explaining their inference processes and ﬁnal results, and they are typically treated as a black-box by both developers and users. Some people even consider DNNs (deep neural networks) in the current stage rather as alchemy, than as real science. In many real-world applications such as business decision, process optimization, medical diagnosis and investment recommendation, explainability and transparency of our AI systems become particularly essential for their users, for the people who are aﬀected by AI decisions, and furthermore, for the researchers and developers who create the AI solutions. In recent years, the explainability and explainable AI have received increasing attention by both research community and industry. This paper ﬁrst introduces the history of Explainable AI, starting from expert systems and traditional machine learning approaches to the latest progress in the context of modern deep learning, and then describes the major research areas and the state-ofart approaches in recent years.

This source of information has been ignored by most of the current recommender systems while it can potentially alleviate the sparsity problem and improve the quality of recommendations. In this paper, we present a deep model to learn item properties and user behaviors jointly from review text. The proposed model, named Deep Cooperative Neural Networks (DeepCoNN), consists of two parallel neural networks coupled in the last layers. One of the networks focuses on learning user behaviors exploiting reviews written by the user, and the other one learns item properties from the reviews written for the item. A shared layer is introduced on the top to couple these two networks together. The shared layer enables latent factors learned for users and items to interact with each other in a manner similar to factorization machine techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that DeepCoNN signiﬁcantly outperforms all baseline recommender systems on a variety of datasets.},

	abstract = {Explainable Recommendations provide the reasons behind why an item is recommended to a user, which often leads to increased user satisfaction and persuasiveness. An intuitive way to explain recommendations is by generating a synthetic personalized natural language review for a user-item pair. Although there exist some approaches in the literature that explain recommendations by generating reviews, the quality of the reviews is questionable. Besides, these methods usually take considerable time to train the underlying language model responsible for generating the text. In this work, we propose ReXPlug, an end-to-end framework with a plug and play way of explaining recommendations. ReXPlug predicts accurate ratings as well as exploits Plug and Play Language Model to generate high-quality reviews. We train a simple sentiment classifier for controlling a pre-trained language model for the generation, bypassing the language model’s training from scratch again. Such a simple and neat model is much easier to implement and train, and hence, very efficient for generating reviews. We personalize the reviews by leveraging a special jointly-trained cross attention network. Our detailed experiments show that ReXPlug outperforms many recent models across various datasets on rating prediction by utilizing textual reviews as a regularizer. Quantitative analysis shows that the reviews generated by ReXPlug are semantically close to the ground truth reviews, while the qualitative analysis demonstrates the high quality of the generated reviews, both from empirical and analytical viewpoints. Our implementation1 is available online.},

The performance of a statistical machine translation system is empirically found to improve by using the conditional probabilities of phrase pairs computed by the RNN Encoder–Decoder as an additional feature in the existing log-linear model.

	abstract = {We consider the task of text attribute transfer: transforming a sentence to alter a speciﬁc attribute (e.g., sentiment) while preserving its attribute-independent content (e.g., changing “screen is just the right size” to “screen is too small”). Our training data includes only sentences labeled with their attribute (e.g., positive or negative), but not pairs of sentences that differ only in their attributes, so we must learn to disentangle attributes from attributeindependent content in an unsupervised way. Previous work using adversarial methods has struggled to produce high-quality outputs. In this paper, we propose simpler methods motivated by the observation that text attributes are often marked by distinctive phrases (e.g., “too small”). Our strongest method extracts content words by deleting phrases associated with the sentence’s original attribute value, retrieves new phrases associated with the target attribute, and uses a neural model to ﬂuently combine these into a ﬁnal output. On human evaluation, our best method generates grammatical and appropriate responses on 22\% more inputs than the best previous system, averaged over three attribute transfer datasets: altering sentiment of reviews on Yelp, altering sentiment of reviews on Amazon, and altering image captions to be more romantic or humorous.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12790},
	abstract = {Undirected neural sequence models such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) have received renewed interest due to their success on discriminative natural language understanding tasks such as questionanswering and natural language inference. The problem of generating sequences directly from these models has received relatively little attention, in part because generating from undirected models departs signiﬁcantly from conventional monotonic generation in directed sequence models. We investigate this problem by proposing a generalized model of sequence generation that uniﬁes decoding in directed and undirected models. The proposed framework models the process of generation rather than the resulting sequence, and under this framework, we derive various neural sequence models as special cases, such as autoregressive, semi-autoregressive, and reﬁnementbased non-autoregressive models. This uniﬁcation enables us to adapt decoding algorithms originally developed for directed sequence models to undirected sequence models. We demonstrate this by evaluating various handcrafted and learned decoding strategies on a BERT-like machine translation model (Lample \& Conneau, 2019). The proposed approach achieves constant-time translation results on par with linear-time translation results from the same undirected sequence model, while both are competitive with the state-of-theart on WMT’14 English-German translation.},

	abstract = {Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is an end-to-end learning approach for automated translation, with the potential to overcome many of the weaknesses of conventional phrase-based translation systems. Unfortunately, NMT systems are known to be computationally expensive both in training and in translation inference – sometimes prohibitively so in the case of very large data sets and large models. Several authors have also charged that NMT systems lack robustness, particularly when input sentences contain rare words. These issues have hindered NMT’s use in practical deployments and services, where both accuracy and speed are essential. In this work, we present GNMT, Google’s Neural Machine Translation system, which attempts to address many of these issues. Our model consists of a deep LSTM network with 8 encoder and 8 decoder layers using residual connections as well as attention connections from the decoder network to the encoder. To improve parallelism and therefore decrease training time, our attention mechanism connects the bottom layer of the decoder to the top layer of the encoder. To accelerate the ﬁnal translation speed, we employ low-precision arithmetic during inference computations. To improve handling of rare words, we divide words into a limited set of common sub-word units (“wordpieces”) for both input and output. This method provides a good balance between the ﬂexibility of “character”-delimited models and the eﬃciency of “word”-delimited models, naturally handles translation of rare words, and ultimately improves the overall accuracy of the system. Our beam search technique employs a length-normalization procedure and uses a coverage penalty, which encourages generation of an output sentence that is most likely to cover all the words in the source sentence. To directly optimize the translation BLEU scores, we consider reﬁning the models by using reinforcement learning, but we found that the improvement in the BLEU scores did not reﬂect in the human evaluation. On the WMT’14 English-to-French and English-to-German benchmarks, GNMT achieves competitive results to state-of-the-art. Using a human side-by-side evaluation on a set of isolated simple sentences, it reduces translation errors by an average of 60\% compared to Google’s phrase-based production system.},

We test the technique on the problem of Text Summarization (TS). Extractive TS relies on the concept of sentence salience to identify the most important sentences in a document or set of documents. Salience is typically deﬁned in terms of the presence of particular important words or in terms of similarity to a centroid pseudo-sentence. We consider a new approach, LexRank, for computing sentence importance based on the concept of eigenvector centrality in a graph representation of sentences. In this model, a connectivity matrix based on intra-sentence cosine similarity is used as the adjacency matrix of the graph representation of sentences. Our system, based on LexRank ranked in ﬁrst place in more than one task in the recent DUC 2004 evaluation. In this paper we present a detailed analysis of our approach and apply it to a larger data set including data from earlier DUC evaluations. We discuss several methods to compute centrality using the similarity graph. The results show that degree-based methods (including LexRank) outperform both centroid-based methods and other systems participating in DUC in most of the cases. Furthermore, the LexRank with threshold method outperforms the other degree-based techniques including continuous LexRank. We also show that our approach is quite insensitive to the noise in the data that may result from an imperfect topical clustering of documents.},

Mining important attributes of items from customer perspectives and presenting them along with item sets as recommendations can provide users more explainability and help them make better purchase decision. In this work, we generalize the attribute-aware item-set recommendation problem, and develop a new approach to generate sets of items (recommendations) with corresponding important attributes (explanations) that can best justify why the items are recommended to users. In particular, we propose a system that learns important attributes from historical user behavior to derive item set recommendations, so that an organized view of recommendations and their attribute-driven explanations can help users more easily understand how the recommendations relate to their preferences. Our approach is geared towards real world scenarios: we expect a solution to be scalable to billions of items, and be able to learn item and attribute relevance automatically from user behavior without human annotations. To this end, we propose a multi-step learning-based framework called Extract-Expect-Explain (EX3), which is able to adaptively select recommended items and important attributes for users. We experiment on a large-scale realworld benchmark and the results show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by an 11.35\% increase on NDCG with adaptive explainability for item set recommendation.},

A similar phenomenon is observable in human language communication. For example, humans tend to repeat entity names or even long phrases in conversation. The challenge with regard to copying in Seq2Seq is that new machinery is needed to decide when to perform the operation. In this paper, we incorporate copying into neural networkbased Seq2Seq learning and propose a new model called COPYNET with encoderdecoder structure. COPYNET can nicely integrate the regular way of word generation in the decoder with the new copying mechanism which can choose subsequences in the input sequence and put them at proper places in the output sequence. Our empirical study on both synthetic data sets and real world data sets demonstrates the efﬁcacy of COPYNET. For example, COPYNET can outperform regular RNN-based model with remarkable margins on text summarization tasks.},

While fairly successful, these methods usually do not produce highly coherent aspects. In this paper, we present a novel neural approach with the aim of discovering coherent aspects. The model improves coherence by exploiting the distribution of word co-occurrences through the use of neural word embeddings. Unlike topic models which typically assume independently generated words, word embedding models encourage words that appear in similar contexts to be located close to each other in the embedding space. In addition, we use an attention mechanism to de-emphasize irrelevant words during training, further improving the coherence of aspects. Experimental results on real-life datasets demonstrate that our approach discovers more meaningful and coherent aspects, and substantially outperforms baseline methods on several evaluation tasks.},

	abstract = {Review based recommendation utilizes both users’ rating records and the associated reviews for recommendation. Recently, with the rapid demand for explanations of recommendation results, reviews are used to train the encoder–decoder models for explanation text generation. As most of the reviews are general text without detailed evaluation, some researchers leveraged auxiliary information of users or items to enrich the generated explanation text. Nevertheless, the auxiliary data is not available in most scenarios and may suffer from data privacy problems. In this article, we argue that the reviews contain abundant semantic information to express the users’ feelings for various aspects of items, while these information are not fully explored in current explanation text generation task. To this end, we study how to generate more fine-grained explanation text in review based recommendation without any auxiliary data. Though the idea is simple, it is non-trivial since the aspect is hidden and unlabeled. Besides, it is also very challenging to inject aspect information for generating explanation text with noisy review input. To solve these challenges, we first leverage an advanced unsupervised neural aspect extraction model to learn the aspect-aware representation of each review sentence. Thus, users and items can be represented in the aspect space based on their historical associated reviews. After that, we detail how to better predict ratings and generate explanation text with the user and item representations in the aspect space. We further dynamically assign review sentences which contain larger proportion of aspect words with larger weights to control the text generation process, and jointly optimize rating prediction accuracy and explanation text generation quality with a multi-task learning framework. Finally, extensive experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model for both recommendation accuracy and explainability.},

Recently, explainable recommendation has attracted much attention from research community. However, trade-off exists between explainability and performance of the recommendation where metadata is often needed to alleviate the dilemma. We present a novel feature mapping approach that maps the uninterpretable general features onto the interpretable aspect features, achieving both satisfactory accuracy and explainability in the recommendations by simultaneous minimization of rating prediction loss and interpretation loss. To evaluate the explainability, we propose two new evaluation metrics speciﬁcally designed for aspect-level explanation using surrogate ground truth. Experimental results demonstrate a strong performance in both recommendation and explaining explanation, eliminating the need for metadata. Code is available from https://github.com/pd90506/AMCF.},

The prosperity of online campaigns is a challenge in online marketing and is usually evaluated by user response through different metrics, such as clicks on advertisement (ad) creatives, subscriptions to products, purchases of items, or explicit user feedback through online surveys. Recent years have witnessed a significant increase in the number of studies using computational approaches, including machine learning methods, for user response prediction. However, existing literature mainly focuses on algorithmic-driven designs to solve specific challenges, and no comprehensive review exists to answer many important questions. What are the parties involved in the online digital advertising eco-systems? What type of data are available for user response prediction? How do we predict user response in a reliable and/or transparent way? In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of user response prediction in online advertising and related recommender applications. Our essential goal is to provide a thorough understanding of online advertising platforms, stakeholders, data availability, and typical ways of user response prediction. We propose a taxonomy to categorize state-of-the-art user response prediction methods, primarily focusing on the current progress of machine learning methods used in different online platforms. In addition, we also review applications of user response prediction, benchmark datasets, and open source codes in the field.},

It is hard to design an appropriate online learning system under these non-identical delay for different types of ads and users. In this paper, we propose to tackle the delayed feedback problem in online advertising by “Following the Prophet” (FTP for short). The key insight is that, if the feedback came instantly for all the logged samples, we could get a model without delayed feedback, namely the “prophet”. Although the prophet cannot be obtained during online learning, we show that we could predict the prophet’s predictions by an aggregation policy on top of a set of multi-task predictions, where each task captures the feedback patterns of different periods. We propose the objective and optimization approach for the policy, and use the logged data to imitate the prophet. Extensive experiments on three real-world advertising datasets show that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art baselines.},

	abstract = {Conversion rate (ctr) prediction is one of the most critical tasks for digital display advertising. Commercial systems often require to update models in an online learning manner to catch up with the evolving data distribution. However, conversions usually do not happen immediately after user clicks. This may result in inaccurate labeling, which is called delayed feedback problem. In previous studies, delayed feedback problem is handled either by waiting positive label for a long period of time, or by consuming the negative sample on its arrival and then insert a positive duplicate when conversion happens later. Indeed, there is a trade-off between waiting for more accurate labels and utilizing fresh data, which is not considered in existing works. To strike a balance in this trade-off, we propose Elapsed-Time Sampling Delayed Feedback Model (ES-DFM), which models the relationship between the observed conversion distribution and the true conversion distribution. Then we optimize the expectation of true conversion distribution via importance sampling under the elapsed-time sampling distribution. We further estimate the importance weight for each instance, which is used as the weight of loss function in ctr prediction. To demonstrate the effectiveness of ES-DFM, we conduct extensive experiments on a public data and a private industrial dataset. Experimental results conﬁrm that our method consistently outperforms the previous state-of-the-art results.},

	abstract = {Recommender system, as an essential part of modern e-commerce, consists of two fundamental modules, namely Click-Through Rate (CTR) and Conversion Rate (ctr) prediction. While ctr has a direct impact on the purchasing volume, its prediction is wellknown challenging due to the Sample Selection Bias (SSB) and Data Sparsity (DS) issues. Although existing methods, typically built on the user sequential behavior path “impression→click→purchase”, is effective for dealing with SSB issue, they still struggle to address the DS issue due to rare purchase training samples. Observing that users always take several purchase-related actions after clicking, we propose a novel idea of post-click behavior decomposition. Specifically, disjoint purchase-related Deterministic Action (DAction) and Other Action (OAction) are inserted between click and purchase in parallel, forming a novel user sequential behavior graph “impression→click→D(O)Action→purchase”. Defining model on this graph enables to leverage all the impression samples over the entire space and extra abundant supervised signals from D(O)Action, which will effectively address the SSB and DS issues together. To this end, we devise a novel deep recommendation model named Elaborated Entire Space Supervised Multi-task Model (𝐸𝑆𝑀2). According to the conditional probability rule defined on the graph, it employs multi-task learning to predict some decomposed sub-targets in parallel and compose them sequentially to formulate the final ctr. Extensive experiments on both offline and online environments demonstrate the superiority of 𝐸𝑆𝑀2 over state-ofthe-art models. The source code and dataset will be released.},

	abstract = {Conversion rate (ctr) prediction is becoming increasingly important in the multi-billion dollar online display advertising industry. It has two major challenges: ﬁrstly, the scarce user history data is very complicated and non-linear; secondly, the time delay between the clicks and the corresponding conversions can be very large, e.g., ranging from seconds to weeks. Existing models usually suffer from such scarce and delayed conversion behaviors. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning framework to tackle the two challenges. Speciﬁcally, we extract the pre-trained embedding from impressions/clicks to assist in conversion models and propose an inner/self-attention mechanism to capture the ﬁne-grained personalized product purchase interests from the sequential click data. Besides, to overcome the time-delay issue, we calibrate the delay model by learning dynamic hazard function with the abundant post-click data more in line with the real distribution. Empirical experiments with real-world user behavior data prove the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

A successful conversion typically has the following sequential events: "exposure → click → conversion". Conventional ctr estimators are trained in the click space, but inference is done in the entire exposure space. They fail to account for the causes of the missing data and treat them as missing at random. Hence, their estimations are highly likely to deviate from the real values by large. In addition, the data sparsity issue can also handicap many industrial ctr estimators which usually have large parameter spaces.},

However, the performance of traditional machine learning models is often impacted due to variations in user and advertiser behavior. For example, search engine traffic for florists usually tends to peak around Valentine’s day, Mother’s day, etc. To overcome, this challenge, in this manuscript we propose three models which are able to incorporate the effects arising due to variations in product demand. The proposed models are a combination of product demand features, specialized data sampling methodologies and ensemble techniques. We demonstrate the performance of our proposed models on datasets obtained from a real-world setting. Our results show that the proposed models more accurately predict the outcome of users interactions with product related advertisements while simultaneously being robust to fluctuations in user and advertiser behaviors.},

The mainstream methods map sparse, high-dimensional categorical features (e.g., user id, item id) into low-dimensional representations with neural networks. Although they have achieved significant advancement in recent years, how to capture user’s diverse interests effectively from past behaviors is still challenging. Recently some works try using attention-based methods to learn the representation from user behavior history adaptively. However, it is insufficient to capture the diversity of user’s interests. As a step forward to improve this goal, we propose a method named Attentive Capsule Network (ACN). It uses Transformers for feature interaction and leverages capsule networks to capture multiple interests from user behavior history. To precisely obtain sequence representation related to the current advertisement, we further design a modified dynamic routing algorithm integrating with an attention mechanism. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed ACN with significant improvement over state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, it also offers good explainability when extracting diverse interest points of users from behavior history.},

In this paper, we rst show that over-prediction and the resulted over-bidding are fundamental challenges for CPA campaigns in a real RTB environment. We then propose a safe prediction framework with conversion a ribution adjustment to handle over-predictions and to further alleviate over-bidding at di erent levels.

There are three major challenges facing RS in Taobao: scalability, sparsity and cold start. In this paper, we present our technical solutions to address these three challenges. The methods are based on a wellknown graph embedding framework. We first construct an item graph from users’ behavior history, and learn the embeddings of all items in the graph. The item embeddings are employed to compute pairwise similarities between all items, which are then used in the recommendation process. To alleviate the sparsity and cold start problems, side information is incorporated into the graph embedding framework. We propose two aggregation methods to integrate the embeddings of items and the corresponding side information. Experimental results from offline experiments show that methods incorporating side information are superior to those that do not. Further, we describe the platform upon which the embedding methods are deployed and the workflow to process the billion-scale data in Taobao. Using A/B test, we show that the online Click-Through-Rates (CTRs) are improved comparing to the previous collaborative filtering based methods widely used in Taobao, further demonstrating the effectiveness and feasibility of our proposed methods in Taobao’s live production environment.},

	abstract = {Conversion Rate (ctr) prediction in modern industrial e-commerce platforms is becoming increasingly important, which directly contributes to the final revenue. In order to address the wellknown sample selection bias (SSB) and data sparsity (DS) issues encountered during ctr modeling, the abundant labeled macro behaviors (𝑖.𝑒., user’s interactions with items) are used. Nonetheless, we observe that several purchase-related micro behaviors (𝑖.𝑒., user’s interactions with specific components on the item detail page) can supplement fine-grained cues for ctr prediction. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel ctr prediction method by Hierarchically Modeling both Micro and Macro behaviors (𝐻 𝑀3). Specifically, we first construct a complete user sequential behavior graph to hierarchically represent micro behaviors and macro behaviors as one-hop and two-hop post-click nodes. Then, we embody 𝐻 𝑀3 as a multi-head deep neural network, which predicts six probability variables corresponding to explicit sub-paths in the graph. They are further combined into the prediction targets of four auxiliary tasks as well as the final 𝐶𝑉 𝑅 according to the conditional probability rule defined on the graph. By employing multi-task learning and leveraging the abundant supervisory labels from micro and macro behaviors, 𝐻 𝑀3 can be trained end-to-end and address the SSB and DS issues. Extensive experiments on both offline and online settings demonstrate the superiority of the proposed 𝐻 𝑀3 over representative state-of-the-art methods.},

	abstract = {Estimating post-click conversion rate (ctr) accurately is crucial for ranking systems in industrial applications such as recommendation and advertising. Conventional ctr modeling applies popular deep learning methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance. However it encounters several task-specific problems in practice, making ctr modeling challenging. For example, conventional ctr models are trained with samples of clicked impressions while utilized to make inference on the entire space with samples of all impressions. This causes a sample selection bias problem. Besides, there exists an extreme data sparsity problem, making the model fitting rather difficult. In this paper, we model ctr in a brand-new perspective by making good use of sequential pattern of user actions, i.e., impression → click → conversion. The proposed Entire Space Multi-task Model (ESMM) can eliminate the two problems simultaneously by i) modeling ctr directly over the entire space, ii) employing a feature representation transfer learning strategy. Experiments on dataset gathered from traffic logs of Taobao’s recommender system demonstrate that ESMM significantly outperforms competitive methods. We also release a sampling version of this dataset to enable future research. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first public dataset which contains samples with sequential dependence of click and conversion labels for ctr modeling.},

	abstract = {Estimating post-click conversion rate (ctr) accurately is crucial in E-commerce. However, ctr prediction usually suffers from three major challenges in practice: i) data sparsity: compared with impressions, conversion samples are often extremely scarce; ii) sample selection bias: conventional ctr models are trained with clicked impressions while making inference on the entire space of all impressions; iii) delayed feedback: many conversions can only be observed after a relatively long and random delay since clicks happened, resulting in many false negative labels during training. Previous studies mainly focus on one or two issues while ignoring the others. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network framework ESDF to tackle the above three challenges simultaneously. Unlike existing methods, ESDF models the ctr prediction from a perspective of entire space, and combines the advantage of user sequential behavior pattern and the time delay factor. Speciﬁcally, ESDF utilizes sequential behavior of user actions on the entire space with all impressions to alleviate the sample selection bias problem. By sharing the embedding parameters between CTR and ctr networks, data sparsity problem is greatly relieved. Different from conventional delayed feedback methods, ESDF does not make any special assumption about the delay distribution. We discretize the delay time by day slot and model the probability based on survival analysis with deep neural network, which is more practical and suitable for industrial situations. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of our method. To the best of our knowledge, ESDF is the ﬁrst attempt to unitedly solve the above three challenges in ctr prediction area. More than that, we release a sampling version of industrial dataset to enable the future research, which is the ﬁrst public dataset that comprises impression, click and delayed conversion labels for ctr modeling.},

	abstract = {Predicting conversion rates (ctrs) in display advertising (e.g., predicting the proportion of users who purchase an item (i.e., a conversion) after its corresponding ad is clicked) is important when measuring the effects of ads shown to users and to understanding the interests of the users. There is generally a time delay (i.e., so-called delayed feedback) between the ad click and conversion. Owing to the delayed feedback, samples that are converted after an observation period may be treated as negative. To overcome this drawback, ctr prediction assuming that the time delay follows an exponential distribution has been proposed. In practice, however, there is no guarantee that the delay is generated from the exponential distribution, and the best distribution with which to represent the delay depends on the data. In this paper, we propose a nonparametric delayed feedback model for ctr prediction that represents the distribution of the time delay without assuming a parametric distribution, such as an exponential or Weibull distribution. Because the distribution of the time delay is modeled depending on the content of an ad and the features of a user, various shapes of the distribution can be represented potentially. In experiments, we show that the proposed model can capture the distribution for the time delay on a synthetic dataset, even when the distribution is complicated. Moreover, on a real dataset, we show that the proposed model outperforms the existing method that assumes an exponential distribution for the time delay in terms of conversion rate prediction.},

Predicting this conversion rate is thus essential for estimating the value of an impression and can be achieved via machine learning. One diﬃculty however is that the conversions can take place long after the impression – up to a month – and this delayed feedback hinders the conversion modeling. We tackle this issue by introducing an additional model that captures the conversion delay. Intuitively, this probabilistic model helps determining whether a user that has not converted should be treated as a negative sample – when the elapsed time is larger than the predicted delay – or should be discarded from the training set – when it is too early to tell. We provide experimental results on real traﬃc logs that demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of the proposed model.},

	abstract = {Smart mobile devices coupled with the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have emerged as a key enabler of modern digital health applications. While cloud computing is now a well established paradigm for analysing IoT captured data in mobile health applications, on-board analysis of data using AI approaches such as Deep Learning (DL) is gaining significant momentum. This is driven primarily by advances in on-board resources enabling modern mobile devices to execute complex DL models, while also offering improved response time and accuracy for rapid decision-making, and enhanced user privacy. While the number of mobile digital health applications that use IoT and DL is increasing, progress is currently impeded by a lack of framework for profiling and evaluating the performance of DL models on mobile devices. To this end, we propose MobDL, a framework for profiling and evaluating DL models running on smart mobile devices. We present the architecture of this framework and devise a novel evaluation methodology for conducting quantitative comparisons of various DL models running on mobile devices. Three diverse digital health applications using heterogeneous data (e.g. image, time series) are introduced. We conduct extensive experimental evaluations using several DL models that have been developed using the data sets obtained for the three digital health applications to validate the effectiveness of the proposed MobDL framework.},

By combining particle swarm optimization and neural network, this research proposes a new hybrid neural prediction algorithm named as PSONN. The algorithm was applied to Pima Indians Diabetes Database and compared with eight other algorithms including Logistic regression, Ridge regression, Lasso regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machine, and Adam (a neural network algorithm). The findings indicated that the proposed algorithm had higher accuracy and stability, but it took more time to execute. It is suggested that, future research could apply parallelization technology for reducing execution time.},

	abstract = {Diabetes prediction is an important data science application in the social healthcare domain. There exist two main challenges in the diabetes prediction task: data heterogeneity since demographic and metabolic data are of different types, data insufficiency since the number of diabetes cases in a single medical center is usually limited. To tackle the above challenges, we employ gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT) to handle data heterogeneity and introduce multi-task learning (MTL) to solve data insufficiency. To this end, Task-wise Split Gradient Boosting Trees (TSGB) is proposed for the multi-center diabetes prediction task. Specifically, we firstly introduce task gain to evaluate each task separately during tree construction, with a theoretical analysis of GBDT’s learning objective. Secondly, we reveal a problem when directly applying GBDT in MTL, i.e., the negative task gain problem. Finally, we propose a novel split method for GBDT in MTL based on the task gain statistics, named task-wise split, as an alternative to standard feature-wise split to overcome the mentioned negative task gain problem. Extensive experiments on a large-scale real-world diabetes dataset and a commonly used benchmark dataset demonstrate TSGB achieves superior performance against several state-of-the-art methods. Detailed case studies further support our analysis of negative task gain problems and provide insightful findings. The proposed TSGB method has been deployed as an online diabetes risk assessment software for early diagnosis.},

The main contribution of this paper is to present a preliminary study on the application of machine learning methods on a public and widely used diabetes dataset. The authors have applied eight different machine learning techniques using PIMA diabetes dataset. The data have been normalized, and Neural Networks, SGD, Random Forest, kNN, Naïve Bayes, AdaBoost, Decision Tree and SVM methods have been applied. First, the techniques have been validated using stratified 10-fold cross-validation. Second, the confusion matrix has been extracted for each method, and the accuracy, recall, precision and F1-score have been calculated. The three methods with better accuracy are Neural Networks, SGD and kNN. These methods report 77.47\%, 76.43\% and 73.96\% of average accuracy between classes.},

	abstract = {In the United States, advances in technology and medical sciences continue to improve the general well-being of the population. With this continued progress, programs such as Medicare are needed to help manage the high costs associated with quality healthcare. Unfortunately, there are individuals who commit fraud for nefarious reasons and personal gain, limiting Medicare’s ability to effectively provide for the healthcare needs of the elderly and other qualifying people. To minimize fraudulent activities, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) released a number of “Big Data” datasets for different parts of the Medicare program. In this paper, we focus on the detection of Medicare fraud using the following CMS datasets: (1) Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data: Physician and Other Supplier (Part B), (2) Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data: Part D Prescriber (Part D), and (3) Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data: Referring Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics and Supplies (DMEPOS). Additionally, we create a fourth dataset which is a combination of the three primary datasets. We discuss data processing for all four datasets and the mapping of real-world provider fraud labels using the List of Excluded Individuals and Entities (LEIE) from the Office of the Inspector General. Our exploratory analysis on Medicare fraud detection involves building and assessing three learners on each dataset. Based on the Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve performance metric, our results show that the Combined dataset with the Logistic Regression (LR) learner yielded the best overall score at 0.816, closely followed by the Part B dataset with LR at 0.805. Overall, the Combined and Part B datasets produced the best fraud detection performance with no statistical difference between these datasets, over all the learners. Therefore, based on our results and the assumption that there is no way to know within which part of Medicare a physician will commit fraud, we suggest using the Combined dataset for detecting fraudulent behavior when a physician has submitted payments through any or all Medicare parts evaluated in our study.},

	abstract = {For many KDD applications, such as detecting criminal activities in E-commerce, finding the rare instances or the outliers, can be more interesting than finding the common patterns. Existing work in outlier detection regards being an outlier as a binary property. In this paper, we contend that for many scenarios, it is more meaningful to assign to each object a
              degree
              of being an outlier. This degree is called the
              local outlier factor
              (LOF) of an object. It is
              local
              in that the degree depends on how isolated the object is with respect to the surrounding neighborhood. We give a detailed formal analysis showing that LOF enjoys many desirable properties. Using real-world datasets, we demonstrate that LOF can be used to find outliers which appear to be meaningful, but can otherwise not be identified with existing approaches. Finally, a careful performance evaluation of our algorithm confirms we show that our approach of finding local outliers can be practical.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.06558},
	abstract = {One of the challenges in display advertising is that the distribution of features and click through rate (CTR) can exhibit large shifts over time due to seasonality, changes to ad campaigns and other factors. The predominant strategy to keep up with these shifts is to train predictive models continuously, on fresh data, in order to prevent them from becoming stale. However, in many ad systems positive labels are only observed after a possibly long and random delay. These delayed labels pose a challenge to data freshness in continuous training: fresh data may not have complete label information at the time they are ingested by the training algorithm. Naive strategies which consider any data point a negative example until a positive label becomes available tend to underestimate CTR, resulting in inferior user experience and suboptimal performance for advertisers. The focus of this paper is to identify the best combination of loss functions and models that enable large-scale learning from a continuous stream of data in the presence of delayed labels. In this work, we compare 5 different loss functions, 3 of them applied to this problem for the first time. We benchmark their performance in offline settings on both public and proprietary datasets in conjunction with shallow and deep model architectures. We also discuss the engineering cost associated with implementing each loss function in a production environment. Finally, we carried out online experiments with the top performing methods, in order to validate their performance in a continuous training scheme. While training on 668 million in-house data points offline, our proposed methods outperform previous state-of-the-art by 3\% relative cross entropy (RCE). During online experiments, we observed 55\% gain in revenue per thousand requests (RPMq) against naive log loss.},

This work is about compressing vectors over categorical attributes to low-dimension discrete vectors. The current hash-based methods compressing vectors over categorical attributes to low-dimension discrete vectors do not provide any guarantee on the Hamming distances between the compressed representations. Here we present FSketch to create sketches for sparse categorical data and an estimator to estimate the pairwise Hamming distances among the uncompressed data only from their sketches. We claim that these sketches can be used in the usual data mining tasks in place of the original data without compromising the quality of the task. For that, we ensure that the sketches also are categorical, sparse, and the Hamming distance estimates are reasonably precise. Both the sketch construction and the Hamming distance estimation algorithms require just a single-pass; furthermore, changes to a data point can be incorporated into its sketch in an efficient manner. The compressibility depends upon how sparse the data is and is independent of the original dimension -- making our algorithm attractive for many real-life scenarios. Our claims are backed by rigorous theoretical analysis of the properties of FSketch and supplemented by extensive comparative evaluations with related algorithms on some real-world datasets. We show that FSketch is significantly faster, and the accuracy obtained by using its sketches are among the top for the standard unsupervised tasks of RMSE, clustering and similarity search.},

In this paper, we show that it is possible to derive an end-to-end learning model that emphasizes both low- and highorder feature interactions. The proposed model, DeepFM, combines the power of factorization machines for recommendation and deep learning for feature learning in a new neural network architecture. Compared to the latest Wide \& Deep model from Google, DeepFM has a shared input to its “wide” and “deep” parts, with no need of feature engineering besides raw features.

	abstract = {Click-through rate prediction is an essential task in industrial applications, such as online advertising. Recently deep learning based models have been proposed, which follow a similar Embedding\&MLP paradigm. In these methods large scale sparse input features are first mapped into low dimensional embedding vectors, and then transformed into fixed-length vectors in a group-wise manner, finally concatenated together to fed into a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to learn the nonlinear relations among features. In this way, user features are compressed into a fixed-length representation vector, in regardless of what candidate ads are. The use of fixed-length vector will be a bottleneck, which brings difficulty for Embedding\&MLP methods to capture user’s diverse interests effectively from rich historical behaviors. In this paper, we propose a novel model: Deep Interest Network (DIN) which tackles this challenge by designing a local activation unit to adaptively learn the representation of user interests from historical behaviors with respect to a certain ad. This representation vector varies over different ads, improving the expressive ability of model greatly. Besides, we develop two techniques: mini-batch aware regularization and data adaptive activation function which can help training industrial deep networks with hundreds of millions of parameters. Experiments on two public datasets as well as an Alibaba real production dataset with over 2 billion samples demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed approaches, which achieve superior performance compared with state-of-the-art methods. DIN now has been successfully deployed in the online display advertising system in Alibaba, serving the main traffic.},

How to capture users’ dynamic and evolving interests from their behavior sequences remains a continuous research topic in the CTR prediction. However, most existing studies overlook the intrinsic structure of the sequences: the sequences are composed of sessions, where sessions are user behaviors separated by their occurring time. We observe that user behaviors are highly homogeneous in each session, and heterogeneous cross sessions. Based on this observation, we propose a novel CTR model named Deep Session Interest Network (DSIN) that leverages users’ multiple historical sessions in their behavior sequences. We ﬁrst use self-attention mechanism with bias encoding to extract users’ interests in each session. Then we apply Bi-LSTM to model how users’ interests evolve and interact among sessions. Finally, we employ the local activation unit to adaptively learn the inﬂuences of various session interests on the target item.

	abstract = {Factorization Machines (FMs) are a supervised learning approach that enhances the linear regression model by incorporating the second-order feature interactions. Despite effectiveness, FM can be hindered by its modelling of all feature interactions with the same weight, as not all feature interactions are equally useful and predictive. For example, the interactions with useless features may even introduce noises and adversely degrade the performance. In this work, we improve FM by discriminating the importance of different feature interactions. We propose a novel model named Attentional Factorization Machine (AFM), which learns the importance of each feature interaction from data via a neural attention network. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of AFM. Empirically, it is shown on regression task AFM betters FM with a 8.6\% relative improvement, and consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art deep learning methods Wide\&Deep [Cheng et al., 2016] and DeepCross [Shan et al., 2016] with a much simpler structure and fewer model parameters.

We also proposed a new explanation of FM and FwFM within the FmFM framework, and compared it with the FFM. Besides pruning the cross terms, our model supports field-specific variable dimensions of embedding vectors, which acts as a soft pruning. We also proposed an efficient way to minimize the dimension while keeping the model performance. The FmFM model can also be optimized further by caching the intermediate vectors, and it only takes thousands floating-point operations (FLOPs) to make a prediction. Our experiment results show that it can out-perform the FFM, which is more complex. The FmFM model’s performance is also comparable to DNN models which require much more FLOPs in runtime.},

	abstract = {Click-through rate (CTR) prediction models are common in many online applications such as digital advertising and recommender systems. Field-Aware Factorization Machine (FFM) and Field-weighted Factorization Machine (FwFM) are state-of-the-art among the shallow models for CTR prediction. Recently, many deep learning-based models have also been proposed. Among deeper models, DeepFM, xDeepFM, AutoInt+, and FiBiNet are state-of-the-art models. The deeper models combine a core architectural component, which learns explicit feature interactions, with a deep neural network (DNN) component. We propose a novel shallow Field-Embedded Factorization Machine (FEFM) and its deep counterpart Deep Field-Embedded Factorization Machine (DeepFEFM). FEFM learns symmetric matrix embeddings for each ﬁeld pair along with the usual single vector embeddings for each feature. FEFM has signiﬁcantly lower model complexity than FFM and roughly the same complexity as FwFM. FEFM also has insightful mathematical properties about important ﬁelds and ﬁeld interactions. DeepFEFM combines the FEFM interaction vectors learned by the FEFM component with a DNN and is thus able to learn higher order interactions. We conducted comprehensive experiments over a wide range of hyperparameters on two large publicly available real-world datasets. When comparing test AUC and log loss, the results show that FEFM and DeepFEFM outperform the existing state-of-the-art shallow and deep models for CTR prediction tasks. We have made the code of FEFM and DeepFEFM available in the DeepCTR library(https: //github.com/shenweichen/DeepCTR).},

The data involved in CTR prediction are typically multi-field categorical data, i.e., every feature is categorical and belongs to one and only one field. One of the interesting characteristics of such data is that features from one field often interact differently with features from different other fields. Recently, Fieldaware Factorization Machines (FFMs) have been among the best performing models for CTR prediction by explicitly modeling such difference. However, the number of parameters in FFMs is in the order of feature number times field number, which is unacceptable in the real-world production systems. In this paper, we propose Field-weighted Factorization Machines (FwFMs) to model the different feature interactions between different fields in a much more memory-efficient way. Our experimental evaluations show that FwFMs can achieve competitive prediction performance with only as few as 4\% parameters of FFMs. When using the same number of parameters, FwFMs can bring 0.92\% and 0.47\% AUC lift over FFMs on two real CTR prediction data sets.},

	abstract = {Combinatorial features are essential for the success of many commercial models. Manually crafting these features usually comes with high cost due to the variety, volume and velocity of raw data in web-scale systems. Factorization based models, which measure interactions in terms of vector product, can learn patterns of combinatorial features automatically and generalize to unseen features as well. With the great success of deep neural networks (DNNs) in various fields, recently researchers have proposed several DNN-based factorization model to learn both low- and high-order feature interactions. Despite the powerful ability of learning an arbitrary function from data, plain DNNs generate feature interactions implicitly and at the bit-wise level. In this paper, we propose a novel Compressed Interaction Network (CIN), which aims to generate feature interactions in an explicit fashion and at the vector-wise level. We show that the CIN share some functionalities with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). We further combine a CIN and a classical DNN into one unified model, and named this new model eXtreme Deep Factorization Machine (xDeepFM). On one hand, the xDeepFM is able to learn certain bounded-degree feature interactions explicitly; on the other hand, it can learn arbitrary low- and high-order feature interactions implicitly. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets. Our results demonstrate that xDeepFM outperforms state-of-the-art models.

	abstract = {Click-through rate (CTR) prediction, which aims to predict the probability of a user clicking on an ad or an item, is critical to many online applications such as online advertising and recommender systems. The problem is very challenging since (1) the input features (e.g., the user id, user age, item id, item category) are usually sparse and high-dimensional, and (2) an effective prediction relies on highorder combinatorial features (a.k.a. cross features), which are very time-consuming to hand-craft by domain experts and are impossible to be enumerated. Therefore, there have been efforts in finding lowdimensional representations of the sparse and high-dimensional raw features and their meaningful combinations. In this paper, we propose an effective and efficient method called the AutoInt to automatically learn the high-order feature interactions of input features. Our proposed algorithm is very general, which can be applied to both numerical and categorical input features. Specifically, we map both the numerical and categorical features into the same low-dimensional space. Afterwards, a multihead self-attentive neural network with residual connections is proposed to explicitly model the feature interactions in the lowdimensional space. With different layers of the multi-head selfattentive neural networks, different orders of feature combinations of input features can be modeled. The whole model can be efficiently fit on large-scale raw data in an end-to-end fashion. Experimental results on four real-world datasets show that our proposed approach not only outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches for prediction but also offers good explainability.

Among many real-world advertising and feed ranking systems, click through rate (CTR) prediction plays a central role. There are many proposed models in this field such as logistic regression, tree based models, factorization machine based models and deep learning based CTR models. However, many current works calculate the feature interactions in a simple way such as Hadamard product and inner product and they care less about the importance of features. In this paper, a new model named FiBiNET as an abbreviation for Feature Importance and Bilinear feature Interaction NETwork is proposed to dynamically learn the feature importance and fine-grained feature interactions. On the one hand, the FiBiNET can dynamically learn the importance of features via the Squeeze-Excitation network (SENET) mechanism; on the other hand, it is able to effectively learn the feature interactions via bilinear function. We conduct extensive experiments on two realworld datasets and show that our shallow model outperforms other shallow models such as factorization machine(FM) and field-aware factorization machine(FFM). In order to improve performance further, we combine a classical deep neural network(DNN) component with the shallow model to be a deep model. The deep FiBiNET consistently outperforms the other state-of-the-art deep models such as DeepFM and extreme deep factorization machine(XdeepFM).},

For better user satisfaction and business effectiveness, multitask learning is one of the most important methods in e-commerce. Some existing researches model user representation based on historical behaviour sequence to capture user interests. It is often the case that user interests may change from their past routines. However, multi-perspective attention has broad horizon, which covers different characteristics of human reasoning, emotions, perception, attention, and memory. In this paper, we attempt to introduce the multi-perspective attention and sequence behaviour into multitask learning. Our proposed method offers better understanding of user interest and decision. To achieve more flexible parameter sharing and maintaining the special feature advantage of each task, we improve the attention mechanism at the view of expert interactive. To the best of our knowledge, we firstly propose the implicit interaction mode, the explicit hard interaction mode, the explicit soft interaction mode, and the data fusion mode in multitask learning. We do experiments on public data and lab medical data. The results show that our model consistently achieves remarkable improvements to the state-of-the-art method.},

              We address the problem of user intent prediction from clickstream data of an e-commerce website via two conceptually different approaches: a hand-crafted feature-based classification and a deep learning-based classification. In both approaches, we deliberately coarse-grain a new clickstream proprietary dataset to produce symbolic trajectories with minimal information. Then, we tackle the problem of trajectory classification of arbitrary length and ultimately, early prediction of limited-length trajectories, both for balanced and unbalanced datasets. Our analysis shows that
              k
              -gram statistics with visibility graph motifs produce fast and accurate classifications, highlighting that purchase prediction is reliable even for extremely short observation windows. In the deep learning case, we benchmarked previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on the new dataset, and improved classification accuracy over SOTA performances with our proposed LSTM architecture. We conclude with an in-depth error analysis and a careful evaluation of the pros and cons of the two approaches when applied to realistic industry use cases.},

              Severe class imbalance between majority and minority classes in Big Data can bias the predictive performance of
              Machine Learning
              algorithms toward the majority (negative) class. Where the minority (positive) class holds greater value than the majority (negative) class and the occurrence of false negatives incurs a greater penalty than false positives, the bias may lead to adverse consequences. Our paper incorporates two case studies, each utilizing three learners, six sampling approaches, two performance metrics, and five sampled distribution ratios, to uniquely investigate the effect of severe class imbalance on Big Data analytics. The learners (
              Gradient-Boosted Trees, Logistic Regression, Random Forest
              ) were implemented within the Apache Spark framework. The first case study is based on a Medicare fraud detection dataset. The second case study, unlike the first, includes training data from one source (SlowlorisBig Dataset) and test data from a separate source (POST dataset). Results from the Medicare case study are not conclusive regarding the best sampling approach using
              Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve
              and
              Geometric Mean
              performance metrics. However, it should be noted that the
              Random Undersampling
              approach performs adequately in the first case study. For the SlowlorisBig case study, Random Undersampling convincingly outperforms the other five sampling approaches (
              Random Oversampling, Synthetic Minority Over-sampling TEchnique, SMOTE-borderline1 , SMOTE-borderline2 , ADAptive SYNthetic
              ) when measuring performance with
              Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve
              and
              Geometric Mean
              metrics. Based on its classification performance in both case studies,
              Random Undersampling
              is the best choice as it results in models with a significantly smaller number of samples, thus reducing computational burden and training time.},

Often real-world data sets are predominately composed of “normal” examples with only a small percentage of “abnormal” or “interesting” examples. It is also the case that the cost of misclassifying an abnormal (interesting) example as a normal example is often much higher than the cost of the reverse error. Under-sampling of the majority (normal) class has been proposed as a good means of increasing the sensitivity of a classiﬁer to the minority class. This paper shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority (abnormal) class and under-sampling the majority (normal) class can achieve better classiﬁer performance (in ROC space) than only under-sampling the majority class. This paper also shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority class and under-sampling the majority class can achieve better classiﬁer performance (in ROC space) than varying the loss ratios in Ripper or class priors in Naive Bayes. Our method of over-sampling the minority class involves creating synthetic minority class examples. Experiments are performed using C4.5, Ripper and a Naive Bayes classiﬁer. The method is evaluated using the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) and the ROC convex hull strategy.},

Therefore, such columns are annotated either as integer or string rather than categorical, and need to be transformed into categorical manually by the user. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic type inference method that can identify the general categorical data type (including non-Boolean variables). Additionally, we identify the possible values of each categorical variable by adapting the existing type inference method ptype. Combining these methods, we present ptype-cat which achieves better results than existing applicable solutions.},

	abstract = {Modeling powerful interactions is a critical challenge in Click-through rate (CTR) prediction, which is one of the most typical machine learning tasks in personalized advertising and recommender systems. Although developing hand-crafted interactions is effective for a small number of datasets, it generally requires laborious and tedious architecture engineering for extensive scenarios. In recent years, several neural architecture search (NAS) methods have been proposed for designing interactions automatically. However, existing methods only explore limited types and connections of operators for interaction generation, leading to low generalization ability. To address these problems, we propose a more general automated method for building powerful interactions named AutoPI. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: AutoPI adopts a more general search space in which the computational graph is generalized from existing network connections, and the interactive operators in the edges of the graph are extracted from representative hand-crafted works. It allows searching for various powerful feature interactions to produce higher AUC and lower Logloss in a wide variety of applications. Besides, AutoPI utilizes a gradient-based search strategy for exploration with a significantly low computational cost. Experimentally, we evaluate AutoPI on a diverse suite of benchmark datasets, demonstrating the generalizability and efficiency of AutoPI over hand-crafted architectures and state-of-the-art NAS algorithms.},

	abstract = {Graph machine learning has been extensively studied in both academic and industry. However, as the literature on graph learning booms with a vast number of emerging methods and techniques, it becomes increasingly difficult to manually design the optimal machine learning algorithm for different graph-related tasks. To tackle the challenge, automated graph machine learning, which aims at discovering the best hyper-parameter and neural architecture configuration for different graph tasks/data without manual design, is gaining an increasing number of attentions from the research community. In this paper, we extensively discuss automated graph machine approaches, covering hyper-parameter optimization (HPO) and neural architecture search (NAS) for graph machine learning. We briefly overview existing libraries designed for either graph machine learning or automated machine learning respectively, and further in depth introduce AutoGL, our dedicated and the world's first open-source library for automated graph machine learning. Last but not least, we share our insights on future research directions for automated graph machine learning. This paper is the first systematic and comprehensive discussion of approaches, libraries as well as directions for automated graph machine learning.},

	abstract = {Various neural network-based approaches have been proposed for more robust and accurate voice activity detection (VAD). Manual design of such neural architectures is an error-prone and time-consuming process, which prompted the development of neural architecture search (NAS) that automatically design and optimize network architectures. While NAS has been successfully applied to improve performance in a variety of tasks, it has not yet been exploited in the VAD domain. In this paper, we present the first work that utilizes NAS approaches on the VAD task. To effectively search architectures for the VAD task, we propose a modified macro structure and a new search space with a much broader range of operations that includes attention operations. The results show that the network structures found by the propose NAS framework outperform previous manually designed state-of-the-art VAD models in various noise-added and real-world-recorded datasets. We also show that the architectures searched on a particular dataset achieve improved generalization performance on unseen audio datasets.

	abstract = {The release of tabular benchmarks, such as NAS-Bench-101 and NAS-Bench-201, has significantly lowered the computational overhead for conducting scientific research in neural architecture search (NAS). Although they have been widely adopted and used to tune real-world NAS algorithms, these benchmarks are limited to small search spaces and focus solely on image classification. Recently, several new NAS benchmarks have been introduced that cover significantly larger search spaces over a wide range of tasks, including object detection, speech recognition, and natural language processing. However, substantial differences among these NAS benchmarks have so far prevented their widespread adoption, limiting researchers to using just a few benchmarks. In this work, we present an in-depth analysis of popular NAS algorithms and performance prediction methods across 25 different combinations of search spaces and datasets, finding that many conclusions drawn from a few NAS benchmarks do not generalize to other benchmarks. To help remedy this problem, we introduce NAS-Bench-Suite, a comprehensive and extensible collection of NAS benchmarks, accessible through a unified interface, created with the aim to facilitate reproducible, generalizable, and rapid NAS research.

In this paper, we review some Machine Learning (ML) models and methods proposed in the literature to analyze their strengths and weaknesses. Then, we propose their use—alone or in combination with other approaches—to provide possible valid AutoML solutions. We analyze those solutions from a theoretical point of view and evaluate them empirically on three Atari games from the Arcade Learning Environment. Our goal is to identify what, we believe, could be some promising ways to create truly effective AutoML frameworks, therefore able to replace the human expert as much as possible, thereby making easier the process of applying ML approaches to typical problems of specific domains. We hope that the findings of our study will provide useful insights for future research work in AutoML.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.09336},
	abstract = {Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods have been growing in popularity. These techniques have been fundamental to automate and speed up the time consuming and error-prone process of synthesizing novel Deep Learning (DL) architectures. NAS has been extensively studied in the past few years. Arguably their most significant impact has been in image classification and object detection tasks where the state of the art results have been obtained. Despite the significant success achieved to date, applying NAS to real-world problems still poses significant challenges and is not widely practical. In general, the synthesized Convolution Neural Network (CNN) architectures are too complex to be deployed in resource-limited platforms, such as IoT, mobile, and embedded systems. One solution growing in popularity is to use multi-objective optimization algorithms in the NAS search strategy by taking into account execution latency, energy consumption, memory footprint, etc. This kind of NAS, called hardware-aware NAS (HW-NAS), makes searching the most efficient architecture more complicated and opens several questions. In this survey, we provide a detailed review of existing HW-NAS research and categorize them according to four key dimensions: the search space, the search strategy, the acceleration technique, and the hardware cost estimation strategies. We further discuss the challenges and limitations of existing approaches and potential future directions. This is the first survey paper focusing on hardware-aware NAS. We hope it serves as a valuable reference for the various techniques and algorithms discussed and paves the road for future research towards hardware-aware NAS.},

	abstract = {HardWare-aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) has recently gained tremendous attention by automating the design of DNNs deployed in more resource-constrained daily life devices. Despite its promising performance, developing optimal HW-NAS solutions can be prohibitively challenging as it requires cross-disciplinary knowledge in the algorithm, micro-architecture, and device-specific compilation. First, to determine the hardware-cost to be incorporated into the NAS process, existing works mostly adopt either pre-collected hardware-cost look-up tables or device-specific hardware-cost models. Both of them limit the development of HW-NAS innovations and impose a barrier-to-entry to non-hardware experts. Second, similar to generic NAS, it can be notoriously difficult to benchmark HW-NAS algorithms due to their significant required computational resources and the differences in adopted search spaces, hyperparameters, and hardware devices. To this end, we develop HW-NAS-Bench, the first public dataset for HW-NAS research which aims to democratize HW-NAS research to non-hardware experts and make HW-NAS research more reproducible and accessible. To design HW-NAS-Bench, we carefully collected the measured/estimated hardware performance of all the networks in the search spaces of both NAS-Bench-201 and FBNet, on six hardware devices that fall into three categories (i.e., commercial edge devices, FPGA, and ASIC). Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the collected measurements in HW-NAS-Bench to provide insights for HW-NAS research. Finally, we demonstrate exemplary user cases to (1) show that HW-NAS-Bench allows non-hardware experts to perform HW-NAS by simply querying it and (2) verify that dedicated device-specific HW-NAS can indeed lead to optimal accuracy-cost trade-offs.

In this paper, we propose a framework to decouple network structure from operator search space, and use two BOHBs to search alternatively. Considering that activation function and initialization are also important parts of neural network, the generalization ability of the model will be affected. We introduce an activation function and an initialization method domain, and add them into the operator search space to form a generalized search space, so as to improve the generalization ability of the child model. We then trained a GCN-based predictor using feedback from the child model. This can not only improve the search efficiency, but also solve the problem of dimension curse. Next, unlike other NAS studies, we used predictors to analyze the stability of different network structures. Finally, we applied our framework to neural structure search and achieved significant improvements on multiple datasets.},

New NAS methods have recently made progress in improving the efficiency of this process. We implement an extensible and modular framework for Differentiable Neural Architecture Search (DNAS) to help solve this problem. We include an overview of the major components of our codebase and how they interact, as well as a section on implementing extensions to it (including a sample), in order to help users adopt our framework for their applications across different categories of deep learning models. To assess the capabilities of our methodology and implementation, we apply DNAS to the problem of ads click-through rate (CTR) prediction, arguably the highest-value and most worked on AI problem at hyperscalers today. We develop and tailor novel search spaces to a Deep Learning Recommendation Model (DLRM) backbone for CTR prediction, and report state-of-the-art results on the Criteo Kaggle CTR prediction dataset.},

	abstract = {Native advertising, also called sponsored content, is a type of advertising that matches the form and function of the platform upon which it appears. In many cases it functions like an advertorial, and manifests as a video, article or editorial. The word native refers to this coherence of the content with the other media that appear on the platform.
These ads reduce a consumers' ad recognition by blending the ad into the native content of the platform, even if it is labeled as "sponsored" or "branded" content. Readers may have difficulty immediately identifying them as advertisements due to their ambiguous nature, especially when deceptive labels such as "From around the web" are used.Product placement (embedded marketing) is a precursor to native advertising. The former places the product within the content, whereas in native marketing, which is legally permissible in the US to the extent that there is sufficient disclosure, the product and content are merged.},

	abstract = {In Internet marketing, search advertising is a method of placing online advertisements on web pages that show results from search engine queries. Through the same search-engine advertising services, ads can also be placed on Web pages with other published content.

Search advertisements are targeted to match key search terms (called keywords) entered on search engines. This targeting ability has contributed to the attractiveness of search advertising for advertisers. Consumers will often use a search engine to identify and compare purchasing options immediately before making a purchasing decision. The opportunity to present consumers with advertisements tailored to their immediate buying interests encourages consumers to click on search ads instead of unpaid search results, which are often less relevant. For the online user, Sponsored Search Advertisement offers highly relevant search results which are based on the consumer’s own queries and, thus, they are considered less intrusive than banner advertisements or pop-ups advertising. In addition, Sponsored Search Advertisement reduces online user search costs and increases the accessibility to useful information within a limited time frame. Consequently, Sponsored Search Advertisement has become an important element of online users browsing and information searching experiences on the Web. Search advertising is an alternative to SEO and SEM.},

	abstract = {Deep learning has made breakthroughs and substantial in many fields due to its powerful automatic representation capabilities. It has been proven that neural architecture design is crucial to the feature representation of data and the final performance. However, the design of the neural architecture heavily relies on the researchers' prior knowledge and experience. And due to the limitations of human' inherent knowledge, it is difficult for people to jump out of their original thinking paradigm and design an optimal model. Therefore, an intuitive idea would be to reduce human intervention as much as possible and let the algorithm automatically design the neural architecture. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is just such a revolutionary algorithm, and the related research work is complicated and rich. Therefore, a comprehensive and systematic survey on the NAS is essential. Previously related surveys have begun to classify existing work mainly based on the key components of NAS: search space, search strategy, and evaluation strategy. While this classification method is more intuitive, it is difficult for readers to grasp the challenges and the landmark work involved. Therefore, in this survey, we provide a new perspective: beginning with an overview of the characteristics of the earliest NAS algorithms, summarizing the problems in these early NAS algorithms, and then providing solutions for subsequent related research work. Besides, we conduct a detailed and comprehensive analysis, comparison, and summary of these works. Finally, we provide some possible future research directions.},

	abstract = {Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction is one of the most important machine learning tasks in recommender systems, driving personalized experience for billions of consumers. Neural architecture search (NAS), as an emerging field, has demonstrated its capabilities in discovering powerful neural network architectures, which motivates us to explore its potential for CTR predictions. Due to 1) diverse unstructured feature interactions, 2) heterogeneous feature space, and 3) high data volume and intrinsic data randomness, it is challenging to construct, search, and compare different architectures effectively for recommendation models. To address these challenges, we propose an automated interaction architecture discovering framework for CTR prediction named AutoCTR. Via modularizing simple yet representative interactions as virtual building blocks and wiring them into a space of direct acyclic graphs, AutoCTR performs evolutionary architecture exploration with learning-to-rank guidance at the architecture level and achieves acceleration using low-fidelity model. Empirical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of AutoCTR on different datasets comparing to human-crafted architectures. The discovered architecture also enjoys generalizability and transferability among different datasets.},

	abstract = {Powered by innovations in novel architecture design, noise tolerance techniques and increasing model capacity, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has made giant strides in reducing word-error-rate over the past decade. ASR models are often trained with tens of thousand hours of high quality speech data to produce state-of-the-art (SOTA) results. Industry-scale ASR model training thus remains computationally heavy and time-consuming, and consequently has attracted little attention in adopting automatic techniques. On the other hand, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has gained a lot of interest in the recent years thanks to its successes in discovering efﬁcient architectures, often outperforming handcrafted alternatives. However, by changing the standard training process into a bi-level optimisation problem, NAS approaches often require signiﬁcantly more time and computational power compared to single-model training, and at the same time increase complexity of the overall process. As a result, NAS has been predominately applied to problems which do not require as extensive training as ASR, and even then reproducibility of NAS algorithms is often problematic. Lately, a number of benchmark datasets has been introduced to address reproducibility issues by providing NAS researchers with information about performance of different models obtained through exhaustive evaluation. However, these datasets focus mainly on computer vision and NLP tasks and thus suffer from limited coverage of application domains. In order to increase diversity in the existing NAS benchmarks, and at the same time provide systematic study of the effects of architectural choices for ASR, we release NAS-Bench-ASR – the ﬁrst NAS benchmark for ASR models. The dataset consists of 8, 242 unique models trained on the TIMIT audio dataset for three different target epochs, and each starting from three different initializations. The dataset also includes runtime measurements of all the models on a diverse set of hardware platforms. Lastly, we show that identiﬁed good cell structures in our search space for TIMIT transfer well to a much larger LibriSpeech dataset.},

To attain good performances, the neural network architecture used for a given application must be chosen with care. These architectures are often handcrafted and therefore prone to human biases and sub-optimal selection. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is a framework introduced to mitigate such risks by jointly optimizing the network architectures and its weights. Albeit its novelty, it was applied on complex tasks with signiﬁcant results – e.g. semantic image segmentation. In this technical paper, we aim to evaluate its ability to tackle a challenging operational task: semantic segmentation of objects of interest in satellite imagery. Designing a NAS framework is not trivial and has strong dependencies to hardware constraints. We therefore motivate our NAS approach selection and provide corresponding implementation details. We also present novel ideas to carry out other such use-case studies.},
